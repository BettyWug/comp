It is a record of several years of\r\nvariegated vagabondizing, and its object is rather to help the resting\r\nreader while away an idle hour than afflict him with metaphysics, or goad\r\nhim with science. Still, there is information in the volume; information\r\nconcerning an interesting episode in the history of the Far West, about\r\nwhich no books have been written by persons who were on the ground in\r\nperson, and saw the happenings of the time with their own eyes. I allude\r\nto the rise, growth and culmination of the silver-mining fever in Nevada\r\n-a curious episode, in some respects; the only one, of its peculiar kind,\r\nthat has occurred in the land; and the only one, indeed, that is likely\r\nto occur in it.\r\n\r\nYes, take it all around, there is quite a good deal of information in the\r\nbook. I regret this very much; but really it could not be helped:\r\ninformation appears to stew out of me naturally, like the precious ottar\r\nof roses out of the otter. Sometimes it has seemed to me that I would\r\ngive worlds if I could retain my facts; but it cannot be. The more I calk\r\nup the sources, and the tighter I get, the more I leak wisdom. Therefore,\r\nI can only claim indulgence at the hands of the reader, not\r\njustification.\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nMy Brother appointed Secretary of Nevada--I

A salary of eighteen hundred dollars\r\na year and the title of "Mr. Secretary," gave to the great position an\r\nair of wild and imposing grandeur.  I was young and ignorant, and I\r\nenvied my brother.  I coveted his distinction and his financial splendor,\r\nbut particularly and especially the long, strange journey he was going to\r\nmake, and the curious new world he was going to explore.  He was going to\r\ntravel!  I never had been away from home, and that word "travel" had a\r\nseductive charm for me.  Pretty soon he would be hundreds and hundreds of\r\nmiles away on the great plains and deserts, and among the mountains of\r\nthe Far West, and would see buffaloes and Indians, and prairie dogs, and\r\nantelopes, and have all kinds of adventures, and may be get hanged or\r\nscalped, and have ever such a fine time, and write home and tell us all\r\nabout it, and be a hero.  And he would see the gold mines and the silver\r\nmines, and maybe go about of an afternoon when his work was done, and\r\npick up two or three pailfuls of shining slugs, and nuggets of gold and\r\nsilver on the hillside.  And by and by he would become very rich, and\r\nreturn home by sea, and be able to talk as calmly about San Francisco and\r\nthe ocean, and "the isthmus" as if it was nothing of any consequence to\r\nhave seen those marvels face to face.  What I suffered in contemplating\r\nhis happiness, pen cannot describe.  And so, when he offered me, in cold\r\nblood, the sublime position of private secretary under him, it appeared\r\nto me that the heavens and the earth passed away, and the firmament was\r\nrolled together as a scroll!  I had nothing more to desire.  My\r\ncontentment was complete.\r\n\r\nAt the end of an hour or two I was ready for the journey.  Not much\r\npacking up was necessary, because we were going in the overland stage\r\nfrom the Missouri frontier to Nevada, and passengers were only allowed a\r\nsmall quantity of baggage apiece.  There was no Pacific railroad in those\r\nfine times of ten or twelve years ago--not a single rail of it.\r\nI only proposed to stay in Nevada three months--I had no thought of\r\nstaying longer than that.  I meant to see all I could that was new and\r\nstrange, and then hurry home to business.  I little thought that I would\r\nnot see the end of that three-month pleasure excursion for six or seven\r\nuncommonly long years!\r\n\r\nI dreamed all night about Indians, deserts, and silver bars, and in due\r\ntime, next day, we took shipping at the St. Louis wharf on board a\r\nsteamboat bound up the Missouri River.\r\n\r\nWe were six days going from St. Louis to "St. Jo."--a trip that was so\r\ndull, and sleepy, and eventless that it has left no more impression on my\r\nmemory than if its duration had been six minutes instead of that many\r\ndays.  No record is left in my mind, now, concerning it, but a confused\r\njumble of savage-looking snags, which we deliberately walked over with\r\none wheel or the other; and of reefs which we butted and butted, and then\r\nretired from and climbed over in some softer place; and of sand-bars\r\nwhich we roosted on occasionally, and rested, and then got out our\r\ncrutches and sparred over.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the boat might almost as well have gone to St. Jo. by land, for\r\nshe was walking most of the time, anyhow--climbing over reefs and\r\nclambering over snags patiently and laboriously all day long.  The\r\ncaptain said she was a "bully" boat, and all she wanted was more "shear"\r\nand a bigger wheel.  I thought she wanted a pair of stilts, but I had the\r\ndeep sagacity not to say so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nThe first thing we did on that glad evening that landed us at St. Joseph\r\nwas to hunt up the stage-office, and pay a hundred and fifty dollars\r\napiece for tickets per overland coach to Carson City, Nevada.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, bright and early, we took a hasty breakfast, and\r\nhurried to the starting-place.  Then an inconvenience presented itself\r\nwhich we had not properly appreciated before, namely, that one cannot\r\nmake a heavy traveling trunk stand for twenty-five pounds of baggage\r\n--because it weighs a good deal more.  But that was all we could take\r\n--twenty-five pounds each.  So we had to snatch our trunks open, and make a\r\nselection in a good deal of a hurry.  We put our lawful twenty-five\r\npounds apiece all in one valise, and shipped the trunks back to St. Louis\r\nagain.  It was a sad parting, for now we had no swallow-tail coats and\r\nwhite kid gloves to wear at Pawnee receptions in the Rocky Mountains, and\r\nno stove-pipe hats nor patent-leather boots, nor anything else necessary\r\nto make life calm and peaceful.  We were reduced to a war-footing.  Each\r\nof us put on a rough, heavy suit of clothing, woolen army shirt and\r\n"stogy" boots included; and into the valise we crowded a few white\r\nshirts, some under-clothing and such things.  My brother, the Secretary,\r\ntook along about four pounds of United States statutes and six pounds of\r\nUnabridged Dictionary; for we did not know--poor innocents--that such\r\nthings could be bought in San Francisco on one day and received in Carson\r\nCity the next.  I was armed to the teeth with a pitiful little Smith &\r\nWesson\'s seven-shooter, which carried a ball like a homoeopathic pill,\r\nand it took the whole seven to make a dose for an adult.  But I thought\r\nit was grand.  It appeared to me to be a dangerous weapon.  It only had\r\none fault--you could not hit anything with it.  One of our "conductors"\r\npracticed awhile on a cow with it, and as long as she stood still and\r\nbehaved herself she was safe; but as soon as she went to moving about,\r\nand he got to shooting at other things, she came to grief.  The Secretary\r\nhad a small-sized Colt\'s revolver strapped around him for protection\r\nagainst the Indians, and to guard against accidents he carried it\r\nuncapped.  Mr. George Bemis was dismally formidable.  George Bemis was\r\nour fellow-traveler.\r\n\r\nWe had never seen him before.  He wore in his belt an old original\r\n"Allen" revolver, such as irreverent people called a "pepper-box." Simply\r\ndrawing the trigger back, cocked and fired the pistol.  As the trigger\r\ncame back, the hammer would begin to rise and the barrel to turn over,\r\nand presently down would drop the hammer, and away would speed the ball.\r\nTo aim along the turning barrel and hit the thing aimed at was a feat\r\nwhich was probably never done with an "Allen" in the world.  But George\'s\r\nwas a reliable weapon, nevertheless, because, as one of the stage-drivers\r\nafterward said, "If she didn\'t get what she went after, she would fetch\r\nsomething else." And so she did.  She went after a deuce of spades nailed\r\nagainst a tree, once, and fetched a mule standing about thirty yards to\r\nthe left of it.  Bemis did not want the mule; but the owner came out with\r\na double-barreled shotgun and persuaded him to buy it, anyhow.  It was a\r\ncheerful weapon--the "Allen." Sometimes all its six barrels would go off\r\nat once, and then there was no safe place in all the region round about,\r\nbut behind it.\r\n\r\nWe took two or three blankets for protection against frosty weather in\r\nthe mountains.  In the matter of luxuries we were modest--we took none\r\nalong but some pipes and five pounds of smoking tobacco.  We had two\r\nlarge canteens to carry water in, between stations on the Plains, and we\r\nalso took with us a little shot-bag of silver coin for daily expenses in\r\nthe way of breakfasts and dinners.\r\n\r\nBy eight o\'clock everything was ready, and we were on the other side of\r\nthe river.  We jumped into the stage, the driver cracked his whip, and we\r\nbowled away and left "the States" behind us.  It was a superb summer\r\nmorning, and all the landscape was brilliant with sunshine.  There was a\r\nfreshness and breeziness, too, and an exhilarating sense of emancipation\r\nfrom all sorts of cares and responsibilities, that almost made us feel\r\nthat the years we had spent in the close, hot city, toiling and slaving,\r\nhad been wasted and thrown away.  We were spinning along through Kansas,\r\nand in the course of an hour and a half we were fairly abroad on the\r\ngreat Plains.  Just here the land was rolling--a grand sweep of regular\r\nelevations and depressions as far as the eye could reach--like the\r\nstately heave and swell of the ocean\'s bosom after a storm.  And\r\neverywhere were cornfields, accenting with squares of deeper green, this\r\nlimitless expanse of grassy land.  But presently this sea upon dry ground\r\nwas to lose its "rolling" character and stretch away for seven hundred\r\nmiles as level as a floor!\r\n\r\nOur coach was a great swinging and swaying stage, of the most sumptuous\r\ndescription--an imposing cradle on wheels.  It was drawn by six handsome\r\nhorses, and by the side of the driver sat the "conductor," the legitimate\r\ncaptain of the craft; for it was his business to take charge and care of\r\nthe mails, baggage, express matter, and passengers.  We three were the\r\nonly passengers, this trip.  We sat on the back seat, inside.  About all\r\nthe rest of the coach was full of mail bags--for we had three days\'\r\ndelayed mails with us.  Almost touching our knees, a perpendicular wall\r\nof mail matter rose up to the roof.  There was a great pile of it\r\nstrapped on top of the stage, and both the fore and hind boots were full.\r\nWe had twenty-seven hundred pounds of it aboard, the driver said--"a\r\nlittle for Brigham, and Carson, and \'Frisco, but the heft of it for the\r\nInjuns, which is powerful troublesome \'thout they get plenty of truck to\r\nread." But as he just then got up a fearful convulsion of his countenance\r\nwhich was suggestive of a wink being swallowed by an earthquake, we\r\nguessed that his remark was intended to be facetious, and to mean that we\r\nwould unload the most of our mail matter somewhere on the Plains and\r\nleave it to the Indians, or whosoever wanted it.\r\n\r\nWe changed horses every ten miles, all day long, and fairly flew over the\r\nhard, level road.  We jumped out and stretched our legs every time the\r\ncoach stopped, and so the night found us still vivacious and unfatigued.\r\n\r\nAfter supper a woman got in, who lived about fifty miles further on, and\r\nwe three had to take turns at sitting outside with the driver and\r\nconductor.  Apparently she was not a talkative woman.  She would sit\r\nthere in the gathering twilight and fasten her steadfast eyes on a\r\nmosquito rooting into her arm, and slowly she would raise her other hand\r\ntill she had got his range, and then she would launch a slap at him that\r\nwould have jolted a cow; and after that she would sit and contemplate the\r\ncorpse with tranquil satisfaction--for she never missed her mosquito; she\r\nwas a dead shot at short range.  She never removed a carcase, but left\r\nthem there for bait.  I sat by this grim Sphynx and watched her kill\r\nthirty or forty mosquitoes--watched her, and waited for her to say\r\nsomething, but she never did.  So I finally opened the conversation\r\nmyself.  I said:\r\n\r\n"The mosquitoes are pretty bad, about here, madam."\r\n\r\n"You bet!"\r\n\r\n"What did I understand you to say, madam?"\r\n\r\n"You BET!"\r\n\r\nThen she cheered up, and faced around and said:\r\n\r\n"Danged if I didn\'t begin to think you fellers was deef and dumb.  I did,\r\nb\'gosh.  Here I\'ve sot, and sot, and sot, a-bust\'n muskeeters and\r\nwonderin\' what was ailin\' ye.  Fust I thot you was deef and dumb, then I\r\nthot you was sick or crazy, or suthin\', and then by and by I begin to\r\nreckon you was a passel of sickly fools that couldn\'t think of nothing to\r\nsay.  Wher\'d ye come from?"\r\n\r\nThe Sphynx was a Sphynx no more!  The fountains of her great deep were\r\nbroken up, and she rained the nine parts of speech forty days and forty\r\nnights, metaphorically speaking, and buried us under a desolating deluge\r\nof trivial gossip that left not a crag or pinnacle of rejoinder\r\nprojecting above the tossing waste of dislocated grammar and decomposed\r\npronunciation!\r\n\r\nHow we suffered, suffered, suffered!  She went on, hour after hour, till\r\nI was sorry I ever opened the mosquito question and gave her a start.\r\nShe never did stop again until she got to her journey\'s end toward\r\ndaylight; and then she stirred us up as she was leaving the stage (for we\r\nwere nodding, by that time), and said:\r\n\r\n"Now you git out at Cottonwood, you fellers, and lay over a couple o\'\r\ndays, and I\'ll be along some time to-night, and if I can do ye any good\r\nby edgin\' in a word now and then, I\'m right thar.  Folks\'ll tell you\'t\r\nI\'ve always ben kind o\' offish and partic\'lar for a gal that\'s raised in\r\nthe woods, and I am, with the rag-tag and bob-tail, and a gal has to be,\r\nif she wants to be anything, but when people comes along which is my\r\nequals, I reckon I\'m a pretty sociable heifer after all."\r\n\r\nWe resolved not to "lay by at Cottonwood."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour and a half before daylight we were bowling along smoothly\r\nover the road--so smoothly that our cradle only rocked in a gentle,\r\nlulling way, that was gradually soothing us to sleep, and dulling our\r\nconsciousness--when something gave away under us!  We were dimly aware of\r\nit, but indifferent to it.  The coach stopped.  We heard the driver and\r\nconductor talking together outside, and rummaging for a lantern, and\r\nswearing because they could not find it--but we had no interest in\r\nwhatever had happened, and it only added to our comfort to think of those\r\npeople out there at work in the murky night, and we snug in our nest with\r\nthe curtains drawn.  But presently, by the sounds, there seemed to be an\r\nexamination going on, and then the driver\'s voice said:\r\n\r\n"By George, the thoroughbrace is broke!"\r\n\r\nThis startled me broad awake--as an undefined sense of calamity is always\r\napt to do.  I said to myself: "Now, a thoroughbrace is probably part of a\r\nhorse; and doubtless a vital part, too, from the dismay in the driver\'s\r\nvoice.  Leg, maybe--and yet how could he break his leg waltzing along\r\nsuch a road as this?  No, it can\'t be his leg.  That is impossible,\r\nunless he was reaching for the driver.  Now, what can be the\r\nthoroughbrace of a horse, I wonder?  Well, whatever comes, I shall not\r\nair my ignorance in this crowd, anyway."\r\n\r\nJust then the conductor\'s face appeared at a lifted curtain, and his\r\nlantern glared in on us and our wall of mail matter.  He said:\r\n"Gents, you\'ll have to turn out a spell.  Thoroughbrace is broke."\r\n\r\nWe climbed out into a chill drizzle, and felt ever so homeless and\r\ndreary.  When I found that the thing they called a "thoroughbrace" was\r\nthe massive combination of belts and springs which the coach rocks itself\r\nin, I said to the driver:\r\n\r\n"I never saw a thoroughbrace used up like that, before, that I can\r\nremember.  How did it happen?"\r\n\r\n"Why, it happened by trying to make one coach carry three days\' mail\r\n--that\'s how it happened," said he.  "And right here is the very direction\r\nwhich is wrote on all the newspaper-bags which was to be put out for the\r\nInjuns for to keep \'em quiet.  It\'s most uncommon lucky, becuz it\'s so\r\nnation dark I should \'a\' gone by unbeknowns if that air thoroughbrace\r\nhadn\'t broke."\r\n\r\nI knew that he was in labor with another of those winks of his, though I\r\ncould not see his face, because he was bent down at work; and wishing him\r\na safe delivery, I turned to and helped the rest get out the mail-sacks.\r\nIt made a great pyramid by the roadside when it was all out.  When they\r\nhad mended the thoroughbrace we filled the two boots again, but put no\r\nmail on top, and only half as much inside as there was before.  The\r\nconductor bent all the seat-backs down, and then filled the coach just\r\nhalf full of mail-bags from end to end.  We objected loudly to this, for\r\nit left us no seats.  But the conductor was wiser than we, and said a bed\r\nwas better than seats, and moreover, this plan would protect his\r\nthoroughbraces.  We never wanted any seats after that.  The lazy bed was\r\ninfinitely preferable.  I had many an exciting day, subsequently, lying\r\non it reading the statutes and the dictionary, and wondering how the\r\ncharacters would turn out.\r\n\r\nThe conductor said he would send back a guard from the next station to\r\ntake charge of the abandoned mail-bags, and we drove on.\r\n\r\nIt was now just dawn; and as we stretched our cramped legs full length on\r\nthe mail sacks, and gazed out through the windows across the wide wastes\r\nof greensward clad in cool, powdery mist, to where there was an expectant\r\nlook in the eastern horizon, our perfect enjoyment took the form of a\r\ntranquil and contented ecstasy.  The stage whirled along at a spanking\r\ngait, the breeze flapping curtains and suspended coats in a most\r\nexhilarating way; the cradle swayed and swung luxuriously, the pattering\r\nof the horses\' hoofs, the cracking of the driver\'s whip, and his "Hi-yi!\r\ng\'lang!" were music; the spinning ground and the waltzing trees appeared\r\nto give us a mute hurrah as we went by, and then slack up and look after\r\nus with interest, or envy, or something; and as we lay and smoked the\r\npipe of peace and compared all this luxury with the years of tiresome\r\ncity life that had gone before it, we felt that there was only one\r\ncomplete and satisfying happiness in the world, and we had found it.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, at some station whose name I have forgotten, we three\r\nclimbed up on the seat behind the driver, and let the conductor have our\r\nbed for a nap.  And by and by, when the sun made me drowsy, I lay down on\r\nmy face on top of the coach, grasping the slender iron railing, and slept\r\nfor an hour or more.  That will give one an appreciable idea of those\r\nmatchless roads.  Instinct will make a sleeping man grip a fast hold of\r\nthe railing when the stage jolts, but when it only swings and sways, no\r\ngrip is necessary.  Overland drivers and conductors used to sit in their\r\nplaces and sleep thirty or forty minutes at a time, on good roads, while\r\nspinning along at the rate of eight or ten miles an hour.  I saw them do\r\nit, often.  There was no danger about it; a sleeping man will seize the\r\nirons in time when the coach jolts.  These men were hard worked, and it\r\nwas not possible for them to stay awake all the time.\r\n\r\nBy and by we passed through Marysville, and over the Big Blue and Little\r\nSandy; thence about a mile, and entered Nebraska.  About a mile further\r\non, we came to the Big Sandy--one hundred and eighty miles from St.\r\nJoseph.\r\n\r\nAs the sun was going down, we saw the first specimen of an animal known\r\nfamiliarly over two thousand miles of mountain and desert--from Kansas\r\nclear to the Pacific Ocean--as the "jackass rabbit." He is well named.\r\nHe is just like any other rabbit, except that he is from one third to\r\ntwice as large, has longer legs in proportion to his size, and has the\r\nmost preposterous ears that ever were mounted on any creature but a\r\njackass.\r\n\r\nWhen he is sitting quiet, thinking about his sins, or is absent-minded or\r\nunapprehensive of danger, his majestic ears project above him\r\nconspicuously; but the breaking of a twig will scare him nearly to death,\r\nand then he tilts his ears back gently and starts for home.  All you can\r\nsee, then, for the next minute, is his long gray form stretched out\r\nstraight and "streaking it" through the low sage-brush, head erect, eyes\r\nright, and ears just canted a little to the rear, but showing you where\r\nthe animal is, all the time, the same as if he carried a jib.  Now and\r\nthen he makes a marvelous spring with his long legs, high over the\r\nstunted sage-brush, and scores a leap that would make a horse envious.\r\nPresently he comes down to a long, graceful "lope," and shortly he\r\nmysteriously disappears.  He has crouched behind a sage-bush, and will\r\nsit there and listen and tremble until you get within six feet of him,\r\nwhen he will get under way again.  But one must shoot at this creature\r\nonce, if he wishes to see him throw his heart into his heels, and do the\r\nbest he knows how.  He is frightened clear through, now, and he lays his\r\nlong ears down on his back, straightens himself out like a yard-stick\r\nevery spring he makes, and scatters miles behind him with an easy\r\nindifference that is enchanting.\r\n\r\nOur party made this specimen "hump himself," as the conductor said.  The\r\nsecretary started him with a shot from the Colt; I commenced spitting at\r\nhim with my weapon; and all in the same instant the old "Allen\'s" whole\r\nbroadside let go with a rattling crash, and it is not putting it too\r\nstrong to say that the rabbit was frantic!  He dropped his ears, set up\r\nhis tail, and left for San Francisco at a speed which can only be\r\ndescribed as a flash and a vanish!  Long after he was out of sight we\r\ncould hear him whiz.\r\n\r\nI do not remember where we first came across "sage-brush," but as I have\r\nbeen speaking of it I may as well describe it.\r\n\r\nThis is easily done, for if the reader can imagine a gnarled and\r\nvenerable live oak-tree reduced to a little shrub two feet-high, with its\r\nrough bark, its foliage, its twisted boughs, all complete, he can picture\r\nthe "sage-brush" exactly.  Often, on lazy afternoons in the mountains, I\r\nhave lain on the ground with my face under a sage-bush, and entertained\r\nmyself with fancying that the gnats among its foliage were liliputian\r\nbirds, and that the ants marching and countermarching about its base were\r\nliliputian flocks and herds, and myself some vast loafer from Brobdignag\r\nwaiting to catch a little citizen and eat him.\r\n\r\nIt is an imposing monarch of the forest in exquisite miniature, is the\r\n"sage-brush."  Its foliage is a grayish green, and gives that tint to\r\ndesert and mountain.  It smells like our domestic sage, and "sage-tea"\r\nmade from it taste like the sage-tea which all boys are so well\r\nacquainted with.  The sage-brush is a singularly hardy plant, and grows\r\nright in the midst of deep sand, and among barren rocks, where nothing\r\nelse in the vegetable world would try to grow, except "bunch-grass."\r\n--["Bunch-grass" grows on the bleak mountain-sides of Nevada and\r\nneighboring territories, and offers excellent feed for stock, even in the\r\ndead of winter, wherever the snow is blown aside and exposes it;\r\nnotwithstanding its unpromising home, bunch-grass is a better and more\r\nnutritious diet for cattle and horses than almost any other hay or grass\r\nthat is known--so stock-men say.]--The sage-bushes grow from three to\r\nsix or seven feet apart, all over the mountains and deserts of the Far\r\nWest, clear to the borders of California.  There is not a tree of any\r\nkind in the deserts, for hundreds of miles--there is no vegetation at all\r\nin a regular desert, except the sage-brush and its cousin the\r\n"greasewood," which is so much like the sage-brush that the difference\r\namounts to little.  Camp-fires and hot suppers in the deserts would be\r\nimpossible but for the friendly sage-brush.  Its trunk is as large as a\r\nboy\'s wrist (and from that up to a man\'s arm), and its crooked branches\r\nare half as large as its trunk--all good, sound, hard wood, very like\r\noak.\r\n\r\nWhen a party camps, the first thing to be done is to cut sage-brush; and\r\nin a few minutes there is an opulent pile of it ready for use.  A hole a\r\nfoot wide, two feet deep, and two feet long, is dug, and sage-brush\r\nchopped up and burned in it till it is full to the brim with glowing\r\ncoals.  Then the cooking begins, and there is no smoke, and consequently\r\nno swearing.  Such a fire will keep all night, with very little\r\nreplenishing; and it makes a very sociable camp-fire, and one around\r\nwhich the most impossible reminiscences sound plausible, instructive, and\r\nprofoundly entertaining.\r\n\r\nSage-brush is very fair fuel, but as a vegetable it is a distinguished\r\nfailure.  Nothing can abide the taste of it but the jackass and his\r\nillegitimate child the mule.  But their testimony to its nutritiousness\r\nis worth nothing, for they will eat pine knots, or anthracite coal, or\r\nbrass filings, or lead pipe, or old bottles, or anything that comes\r\nhandy, and then go off looking as grateful as if they had had oysters for\r\ndinner.  Mules and donkeys and camels have appetites that anything will\r\nrelieve temporarily, but nothing satisfy.\r\n\r\nIn Syria, once, at the head-waters of the Jordan, a camel took charge of\r\nmy overcoat while the tents were being pitched, and examined it with a\r\ncritical eye, all over, with as much interest as if he had an idea of\r\ngetting one made like it; and then, after he was done figuring on it as\r\nan article of apparel, he began to contemplate it as an article of diet.\r\nHe put his foot on it, and lifted one of the sleeves out with his teeth,\r\nand chewed and chewed at it, gradually taking it in, and all the while\r\nopening and closing his eyes in a kind of religious ecstasy, as if he had\r\nnever tasted anything as good as an overcoat before, in his life.  Then\r\nhe smacked his lips once or twice, and reached after the other sleeve.\r\nNext he tried the velvet collar, and smiled a smile of such contentment\r\nthat it was plain to see that he regarded that as the daintiest thing\r\nabout an overcoat.  The tails went next, along with some percussion caps\r\nand cough candy, and some fig-paste from Constantinople.  And then my\r\nnewspaper correspondence dropped out, and he took a chance in that\r\n--manuscript letters written for the home papers.  But he was treading on\r\ndangerous ground, now.  He began to come across solid wisdom in those\r\ndocuments that was rather weighty on his stomach; and occasionally he\r\nwould take a joke that would shake him up till it loosened his teeth; it\r\nwas getting to be perilous times with him, but he held his grip with good\r\ncourage and hopefully, till at last he began to stumble on statements\r\nthat not even a camel could swallow with impunity.  He began to gag and\r\ngasp, and his eyes to stand out, and his forelegs to spread, and in about\r\na quarter of a minute he fell over as stiff as a carpenter\'s work-bench,\r\nand died a death of indescribable agony.  I went and pulled the\r\nmanuscript out of his mouth, and found that the sensitive creature had\r\nchoked to death on one of the mildest and gentlest statements of fact\r\nthat I ever laid before a trusting public.\r\n\r\nI was about to say, when diverted from my subject, that occasionally one\r\nfinds sage-bushes five or six feet high, and with a spread of branch and\r\nfoliage in proportion, but two or two and a half feet is the usual\r\nheight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nAs the sun went down and the evening chill came on, we made preparation\r\nfor bed.  We stirred up the hard leather letter-sacks, and the knotty\r\ncanvas bags of printed matter (knotty and uneven because of projecting\r\nends and corners of magazines, boxes and books).  We stirred them up and\r\nredisposed them in such a way as to make our bed as level as possible.\r\nAnd we did improve it, too, though after all our work it had an upheaved\r\nand billowy look about it, like a little piece of a stormy sea.  Next we\r\nhunted up our boots from odd nooks among the mail-bags where they had\r\nsettled, and put them on.  Then we got down our coats, vests, pantaloons\r\nand heavy woolen shirts, from the arm-loops where they had been swinging\r\nall day, and clothed ourselves in them--for, there being no ladies either\r\nat the stations or in the coach, and the weather being hot, we had looked\r\nto our comfort by stripping to our underclothing, at nine o\'clock in the\r\nmorning.  All things being now ready, we stowed the uneasy Dictionary\r\nwhere it would lie as quiet as possible, and placed the water-canteens\r\nand pistols where we could find them in the dark.  Then we smoked a final\r\npipe, and swapped a final yarn; after which, we put the pipes, tobacco\r\nand bag of coin in snug holes and caves among the mail-bags, and then\r\nfastened down the coach curtains all around, and made the place as "dark\r\nas the inside of a cow," as the conductor phrased it in his picturesque\r\nway.  It was certainly as dark as any place could be--nothing was even\r\ndimly visible in it.  And finally, we rolled ourselves up like\r\nsilk-worms, each person in his own blanket, and sank peacefully to sleep.\r\n\r\nWhenever the stage stopped to change horses, we would wake up, and try to\r\nrecollect where we were--and succeed--and in a minute or two the stage\r\nwould be off again, and we likewise.  We began to get into country, now,\r\nthreaded here and there with little streams.  These had high, steep banks\r\non each side, and every time we flew down one bank and scrambled up the\r\nother, our party inside got mixed somewhat.  First we would all be down\r\nin a pile at the forward end of the stage, nearly in a sitting posture,\r\nand in a second we would shoot to the other end, and stand on our heads.\r\nAnd we would sprawl and kick, too, and ward off ends and corners of\r\nmail-bags that came lumbering over us and about us; and as the dust rose\r\nfrom the tumult, we would all sneeze in chorus, and the majority of us\r\nwould grumble, and probably say some hasty thing, like: "Take your elbow\r\nout of my ribs!--can\'t you quit crowding?"\r\n\r\nEvery time we avalanched from one end of the stage to the other, the\r\nUnabridged Dictionary would come too; and every time it came it damaged\r\nsomebody.  One trip it "barked" the Secretary\'s elbow; the next trip it\r\nhurt me in the stomach, and the third it tilted Bemis\'s nose up till he\r\ncould look down his nostrils--he said.  The pistols and coin soon settled\r\nto the bottom, but the pipes, pipe-stems, tobacco and canteens clattered\r\nand floundered after the Dictionary every time it made an assault on us,\r\nand aided and abetted the book by spilling tobacco in our eyes, and water\r\ndown our backs.\r\n\r\nStill, all things considered, it was a very comfortable night.  It wore\r\ngradually away, and when at last a cold gray light was visible through\r\nthe puckers and chinks in the curtains, we yawned and stretched with\r\nsatisfaction, shed our cocoons, and felt that we had slept as much as was\r\nnecessary.  By and by, as the sun rose up and warmed the world, we pulled\r\noff our clothes and got ready for breakfast.  We were just pleasantly in\r\ntime, for five minutes afterward the driver sent the weird music of his\r\nbugle winding over the grassy solitudes, and presently we detected a low\r\nhut or two in the distance.  Then the rattling of the coach, the clatter\r\nof our six horses\' hoofs, and the driver\'s crisp commands, awoke to a\r\nlouder and stronger emphasis, and we went sweeping down on the station at\r\nour smartest speed.  It was fascinating--that old overland stagecoaching.\r\n\r\nWe jumped out in undress uniform.  The driver tossed his gathered reins\r\nout on the ground, gaped and stretched complacently, drew off his heavy\r\nbuckskin gloves with great deliberation and insufferable dignity--taking\r\nnot the slightest notice of a dozen solicitous inquires after his health,\r\nand humbly facetious and flattering accostings, and obsequious tenders of\r\nservice, from five or six hairy and half-civilized station-keepers and\r\nhostlers who were nimbly unhitching our steeds and bringing the fresh\r\nteam out of the stables--for in the eyes of the stage-driver of that day,\r\nstation-keepers and hostlers were a sort of good enough low creatures,\r\nuseful in their place, and helping to make up a world, but not the kind\r\nof beings which a person of distinction could afford to concern himself\r\nwith; while, on the contrary, in the eyes of the station-keeper and the\r\nhostler, the stage-driver was a hero--a great and shining dignitary, the\r\nworld\'s favorite son, the envy of the people, the observed of the\r\nnations.  When they spoke to him they received his insolent silence\r\nmeekly, and as being the natural and proper conduct of so great a man;\r\nwhen he opened his lips they all hung on his words with admiration (he\r\nnever honored a particular individual with a remark, but addressed it\r\nwith a broad generality to the horses, the stables, the surrounding\r\ncountry and the human underlings); when he discharged a facetious\r\ninsulting personality at a hostler, that hostler was happy for the day;\r\nwhen he uttered his one jest--old as the hills, coarse, profane, witless,\r\nand inflicted on the same audience, in the same language, every time his\r\ncoach drove up there--the varlets roared, and slapped their thighs, and\r\nswore it was the best thing they\'d ever heard in all their lives.  And\r\nhow they would fly around when he wanted a basin of water, a gourd of the\r\nsame, or a light for his pipe!--but they would instantly insult a\r\npassenger if he so far forgot himself as to crave a favor at their hands.\r\nThey could do that sort of insolence as well as the driver they copied it\r\nfrom--for, let it be borne in mind, the overland driver had but little\r\nless contempt for his passengers than he had for his hostlers.\r\n\r\nThe hostlers and station-keepers treated the really powerful conductor of\r\nthe coach merely with the best of what was their idea of civility, but\r\nthe driver was the only being they bowed down to and worshipped.  How\r\nadmiringly they would gaze up at him in his high seat as he gloved\r\nhimself with lingering deliberation, while some happy hostler held the\r\nbunch of reins aloft, and waited patiently for him to take it!  And how\r\nthey would bombard him with glorifying ejaculations as he cracked his\r\nlong whip and went careering away.\r\n\r\nThe station buildings were long, low huts, made of sundried, mud-colored\r\nbricks, laid up without mortar (adobes, the Spaniards call these bricks,\r\nand Americans shorten it to \'dobies).  The roofs, which had no slant to\r\nthem worth speaking of, were thatched and then sodded or covered with a\r\nthick layer of earth, and from this sprung a pretty rank growth of weeds\r\nand grass.  It was the first time we had ever seen a man\'s front yard on\r\ntop of his house.  The building consisted of barns, stable-room for\r\ntwelve or fifteen horses, and a hut for an eating-room for passengers.\r\nThis latter had bunks in it for the station-keeper and a hostler or two.\r\nYou could rest your elbow on its eaves, and you had to bend in order to\r\nget in at the door.  In place of a window there was a square hole about\r\nlarge enough for a man to crawl through, but this had no glass in it.\r\nThere was no flooring, but the ground was packed hard.  There was no\r\nstove, but the fire-place served all needful purposes.  There were no\r\nshelves, no cupboards, no closets.  In a corner stood an open sack of\r\nflour, and nestling against its base were a couple of black and venerable\r\ntin coffee-pots, a tin teapot, a little bag of salt, and a side of bacon.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the door of the station-keeper\'s den, outside, was a tin wash-basin,\r\non the ground.  Near it was a pail of water and a piece of yellow bar\r\nsoap, and from the eaves hung a hoary blue woolen shirt, significantly\r\n--but this latter was the station-keeper\'s private towel, and only two\r\npersons in all the party might venture to use it--the stage-driver and\r\nthe conductor.  The latter would not, from a sense of decency; the former\r\nwould not, because did not choose to encourage the advances of a\r\nstation-keeper.  We had towels--in the valise; they might as well have\r\nbeen in Sodom and Gomorrah.  We (and the conductor) used our\r\nhandkerchiefs, and the driver his pantaloons and sleeves.  By the door,\r\ninside, was fastened a small old-fashioned looking-glass frame, with two\r\nlittle fragments of the original mirror lodged down in one corner of it.\r\nThis arrangement afforded a pleasant double-barreled portrait of you when\r\nyou looked into it, with one half of your head set up a couple of inches\r\nabove the other half.  From the glass frame hung the half of a comb by a\r\nstring--but if I had to describe that patriarch or die, I believe I would\r\norder some sample coffins.\r\n\r\nIt had come down from Esau and Samson, and had been accumulating hair\r\never since--along with certain impurities.  In one corner of the room\r\nstood three or four rifles and muskets, together with horns and pouches\r\nof ammunition.  The station-men wore pantaloons of coarse, country-woven\r\nstuff, and into the seat and the inside of the legs were sewed ample\r\nadditions of buckskin, to do duty in place of leggings, when the man rode\r\nhorseback--so the pants were half dull blue and half yellow, and\r\nunspeakably picturesque.  The pants were stuffed into the tops of high\r\nboots, the heels whereof were armed with great Spanish spurs, whose\r\nlittle iron clogs and chains jingled with every step.  The man wore a\r\nhuge beard and mustachios, an old slouch hat, a blue woolen shirt, no\r\nsuspenders, no vest, no coat--in a leathern sheath in his belt, a great\r\nlong "navy" revolver (slung on right side, hammer to the front), and\r\nprojecting from his boot a horn-handled bowie-knife.  The furniture of\r\nthe hut was neither gorgeous nor much in the way.  The rocking-chairs and\r\nsofas were not present, and never had been, but they were represented by\r\ntwo three-legged stools, a pine-board bench four feet long, and two empty\r\ncandle-boxes.  The table was a greasy board on stilts, and the\r\ntable-cloth and napkins had not come--and they were not looking for them,\r\neither.  A battered tin platter, a knife and fork, and a tin pint cup,\r\nwere at each man\'s place, and the driver had a queens-ware saucer that\r\nhad seen better days.  Of course this duke sat at the head of the table.\r\nThere was one isolated piece of table furniture that bore about it a\r\ntouching air of grandeur in misfortune.  This was the caster.  It was\r\nGerman silver, and crippled and rusty, but it was so preposterously out\r\nof place there that it was suggestive of a tattered exiled king among\r\nbarbarians, and the majesty of its native position compelled respect even\r\nin its degradation.\r\n\r\nThere was only one cruet left, and that was a stopperless, fly-specked,\r\nbroken-necked thing, with two inches of vinegar in it, and a dozen\r\npreserved flies with their heels up and looking sorry they had invested\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe station-keeper upended a disk of last week\'s bread, of the shape and\r\nsize of an old-time cheese, and carved some slabs from it which were as\r\ngood as Nicholson pavement, and tenderer.\r\n\r\nHe sliced off a piece of bacon for each man, but only the experienced old\r\nhands made out to eat it, for it was condemned army bacon which the\r\nUnited States would not feed to its soldiers in the forts, and the stage\r\ncompany had bought it cheap for the sustenance of their passengers and\r\nemployees.  We may have found this condemned army bacon further out on\r\nthe plains than the section I am locating it in, but we found it--there\r\nis no gainsaying that.\r\n\r\nThen he poured for us a beverage which he called "Slum gullion," and it\r\nis hard to think he was not inspired when he named it.  It really\r\npretended to be tea, but there was too much dish-rag, and sand, and old\r\nbacon-rind in it to deceive the intelligent traveler.\r\n\r\nHe had no sugar and no milk--not even a spoon to stir the ingredients\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nWe could not eat the bread or the meat, nor drink the "slumgullion." And\r\nwhen I looked at that melancholy vinegar-cruet, I thought of the anecdote\r\n(a very, very old one, even at that day) of the traveler who sat down to\r\na table which had nothing on it but a mackerel and a pot of mustard.  He\r\nasked the landlord if this was all.  The landlord said:\r\n\r\n"All!  Why, thunder and lightning, I should think there was mackerel\r\nenough there for six."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t like mackerel."\r\n\r\n"Oh--then help yourself to the mustard."\r\n\r\nIn other days I had considered it a good, a very good, anecdote, but\r\nthere was a dismal plausibility about it, here, that took all the humor\r\nout of it.\r\n\r\nOur breakfast was before us, but our teeth were idle.\r\n\r\nI tasted and smelt, and said I would take coffee, I believed.  The\r\nstation-boss stopped dead still, and glared at me speechless.  At last,\r\nwhen he came to, he turned away and said, as one who communes with\r\nhimself upon a matter too vast to grasp:\r\n\r\n"Coffee!  Well, if that don\'t go clean ahead of me, I\'m d---d!"\r\n\r\nWe could not eat, and there was no conversation among the hostlers and\r\nherdsmen--we all sat at the same board.  At least there was no\r\nconversation further than a single hurried request, now and then, from\r\none employee to another.  It was always in the same form, and always\r\ngruffly friendly.  Its western freshness and novelty startled me, at\r\nfirst, and interested me; but it presently grew monotonous, and lost its\r\ncharm.  It was:\r\n\r\n"Pass the bread, you son of a skunk!"  No, I forget--skunk was not the\r\nword; it seems to me it was still stronger than that; I know it was, in\r\nfact, but it is gone from my memory, apparently.  However, it is no\r\nmatter--probably it was too strong for print, anyway.  It is the landmark\r\nin my memory which tells me where I first encountered the vigorous new\r\nvernacular of the occidental plains and mountains.\r\n\r\nWe gave up the breakfast, and paid our dollar apiece and went back to our\r\nmail-bag bed in the coach, and found comfort in our pipes.  Right here we\r\nsuffered the first diminution of our princely state.  We left our six\r\nfine horses and took six mules in their place.  But they were wild\r\nMexican fellows, and a man had to stand at the head of each of them and\r\nhold him fast while the driver gloved and got himself ready.  And when at\r\nlast he grasped the reins and gave the word, the men sprung suddenly away\r\nfrom the mules\' heads and the coach shot from the station as if it had\r\nissued from a cannon.  How the frantic animals did scamper!  It was a\r\nfierce and furious gallop--and the gait never altered for a moment till\r\nwe reeled off ten or twelve miles and swept up to the next collection of\r\nlittle station-huts and stables.\r\n\r\nSo we flew along all day.  At 2 P.M.  the belt of timber that fringes the\r\nNorth Platte and marks its windings through the vast level floor of the\r\nPlains came in sight.  At 4 P.M.  we crossed a branch of the river, and\r\nat 5 P.M.  we crossed the Platte itself, and landed at Fort Kearney,\r\nfifty-six hours out from St. Joe--THREE HUNDRED MILES!\r\n\r\nNow that was stage-coaching on the great overland, ten or twelve years\r\nago, when perhaps not more than ten men in America, all told, expected to\r\nlive to see a railroad follow that route to the Pacific.  But the\r\nrailroad is there, now, and it pictures a thousand odd comparisons and\r\ncontrasts in my mind to read the following sketch, in the New York Times,\r\nof a recent trip over almost the very ground I have been describing.  I\r\ncan scarcely comprehend the new state of things:\r\n\r\n     "ACROSS THE CONTINENT.\r\n\r\n     "At 4.20 P.M., Sunday, we rolled out of the station at Omaha, and\r\n     started westward on our long jaunt.  A couple of hours out, dinner\r\n     was announced--an \'event\' to those of us who had yet to experience\r\n     what it is to eat in one of Pullman\'s hotels on wheels; so, stepping\r\n     into the car next forward of our sleeping palace, we found ourselves\r\n     in the dining-car.  It was a revelation to us, that first dinner on\r\n     Sunday.  And though we continued to dine for four days, and had as\r\n     many breakfasts and suppers, our whole party never ceased to admire\r\n     the perfection of the arrangements, and the marvelous results\r\n     achieved.  Upon tables covered with snowy linen, and garnished with\r\n     services of solid silver, Ethiop waiters, flitting about in spotless\r\n     white, placed as by magic a repast at which Delmonico himself could\r\n     have had no occasion to blush; and, indeed, in some respects it\r\n     would be hard for that distinguished chef to match our menu; for, in\r\n     addition to all that ordinarily makes up a first-chop dinner, had we\r\n     not our antelope steak (the gormand who has not experienced this\r\n     --bah! what does he know of the feast of fat things?) our delicious\r\n     mountain-brook trout, and choice fruits and berries, and (sauce\r\n     piquant and unpurchasable!) our sweet-scented, appetite-compelling\r\n     air of the prairies?\r\n\r\n     "You may depend upon it, we all did justice to the good things, and\r\n     as we washed them down with bumpers of sparkling Krug, whilst we\r\n     sped along at the rate of thirty miles an hour, agreed it was the\r\n     fastest living we had ever experienced.  (We beat that, however, two\r\n     days afterward when we made twenty-seven miles in twenty-seven\r\n     minutes, while our Champagne glasses filled to the brim spilled not\r\n     a drop!) After dinner we repaired to our drawing-room car, and, as\r\n     it was Sabbath eve, intoned some of the grand old hymns--"Praise God\r\n     from whom," etc.; "Shining Shore," "Coronation," etc.--the voices of\r\n     the men singers and of the women singers blending sweetly in the\r\n     evening air, while our train, with its great, glaring Polyphemus\r\n     eye, lighting up long vistas of prairie, rushed into the night and\r\n     the Wild.  Then to bed in luxurious couches, where we slept the\r\n     sleep of the just and only awoke the next morning (Monday) at eight\r\n     o\'clock, to find ourselves at the crossing of the North Platte,\r\n     three hundred miles from Omaha--fifteen hours and forty minutes\r\n     out."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nAnother night of alternate tranquillity and turmoil.  But morning came,\r\nby and by.  It was another glad awakening to fresh breezes, vast expanses\r\nof level greensward, bright sunlight, an impressive solitude utterly\r\nwithout visible human beings or human habitations, and an atmosphere of\r\nsuch amazing magnifying properties that trees that seemed close at hand\r\nwere more than three mile away.  We resumed undress uniform, climbed\r\na-top of the flying coach, dangled our legs over the side, shouted\r\noccasionally at our frantic mules, merely to see them lay their ears back\r\nand scamper faster, tied our hats on to keep our hair from blowing away,\r\nand leveled an outlook over the world-wide carpet about us for things new\r\nand strange to gaze at.  Even at this day it thrills me through and\r\nthrough to think of the life, the gladness and the wild sense of freedom\r\nthat used to make the blood dance in my veins on those fine overland\r\nmornings!\r\n\r\nAlong about an hour after breakfast we saw the first prairie-dog\r\nvillages, the first antelope, and the first wolf.  If I remember rightly,\r\nthis latter was the regular cayote (pronounced ky-o-te) of the farther\r\ndeserts.  And if it was, he was not a pretty creature or respectable\r\neither, for I got well acquainted with his race afterward, and can speak\r\nwith confidence.  The cayote is a long, slim, sick and sorry-looking\r\nskeleton, with a gray wolf-skin stretched over it, a tolerably bushy tail\r\nthat forever sags down with a despairing expression of forsakenness and\r\nmisery, a furtive and evil eye, and a long, sharp face, with slightly\r\nlifted lip and exposed teeth.  He has a general slinking expression all\r\nover.  The cayote is a living, breathing allegory of Want.  He is always\r\nhungry.\r\n\r\nHe is always poor, out of luck and friendless.  The meanest creatures\r\ndespise him, and even the fleas would desert him for a velocipede.  He is\r\nso spiritless and cowardly that even while his exposed teeth are\r\npretending a threat, the rest of his face is apologizing for it.  And he\r\nis so homely!--so scrawny, and ribby, and coarse-haired, and pitiful.\r\nWhen he sees you he lifts his lip and lets a flash of his teeth out, and\r\nthen turns a little out of the course he was pursuing, depresses his head\r\na bit, and strikes a long, soft-footed trot through the sage-brush,\r\nglancing over his shoulder at you, from time to time, till he is about\r\nout of easy pistol range, and then he stops and takes a deliberate survey\r\nof you; he will trot fifty yards and stop again--another fifty and stop\r\nagain; and finally the gray of his gliding body blends with the gray of\r\nthe sage-brush, and he disappears.  All this is when you make no\r\ndemonstration against him; but if you do, he develops a livelier interest\r\nin his journey, and instantly electrifies his heels and puts such a deal\r\nof real estate between himself and your weapon, that by the time you have\r\nraised the hammer you see that you need a minie rifle, and by the time\r\nyou have got him in line you need a rifled cannon, and by the time you\r\nhave "drawn a bead" on him you see well enough that nothing but an\r\nunusually long-winded streak of lightning could reach him where he is\r\nnow.  But if you start a swift-footed dog after him, you will enjoy it\r\never so much--especially if it is a dog that has a good opinion of\r\nhimself, and has been brought up to think he knows something about speed.\r\n\r\nThe cayote will go swinging gently off on that deceitful trot of his, and\r\nevery little while he will smile a fraudful smile over his shoulder that\r\nwill fill that dog entirely full of encouragement and worldly ambition,\r\nand make him lay his head still lower to the ground, and stretch his neck\r\nfurther to the front, and pant more fiercely, and stick his tail out\r\nstraighter behind, and move his furious legs with a yet wilder frenzy,\r\nand leave a broader and broader, and higher and denser cloud of desert\r\nsand smoking behind, and marking his long wake across the level plain!\r\nAnd all this time the dog is only a short twenty feet behind the cayote,\r\nand to save the soul of him he cannot understand why it is that he cannot\r\nget perceptibly closer; and he begins to get aggravated, and it makes him\r\nmadder and madder to see how gently the cayote glides along and never\r\npants or sweats or ceases to smile; and he grows still more and more\r\nincensed to see how shamefully he has been taken in by an entire\r\nstranger, and what an ignoble swindle that long, calm, soft-footed trot\r\nis; and next he notices that he is getting fagged, and that the cayote\r\nactually has to slacken speed a little to keep from running away from\r\nhim--and then that town-dog is mad in earnest, and he begins to strain\r\nand weep and swear, and paw the sand higher than ever, and reach for the\r\ncayote with concentrated and desperate energy.  This "spurt" finds him\r\nsix feet behind the gliding enemy, and two miles from his friends.  And\r\nthen, in the instant that a wild new hope is lighting up his face, the\r\ncayote turns and smiles blandly upon him once more, and with a something\r\nabout it which seems to say: "Well, I shall have to tear myself away from\r\nyou, bub--business is business, and it will not do for me to be fooling\r\nalong this way all day"--and forthwith there is a rushing sound, and the\r\nsudden splitting of a long crack through the atmosphere, and behold that\r\ndog is solitary and alone in the midst of a vast solitude!\r\n\r\nIt makes his head swim.  He stops, and looks all around; climbs the\r\nnearest sand-mound, and gazes into the distance; shakes his head\r\nreflectively, and then, without a word, he turns and jogs along back to\r\nhis train, and takes up a humble position under the hindmost wagon, and\r\nfeels unspeakably mean, and looks ashamed, and hangs his tail at\r\nhalf-mast for a week.  And for as much as a year after that, whenever\r\nthere is a great hue and cry after a cayote, that dog will merely glance\r\nin that direction without emotion, and apparently observe to himself,\r\n"I believe I do not wish any of the pie."\r\n\r\nThe cayote lives chiefly in the most desolate and forbidding desert,\r\nalong with the lizard, the jackass-rabbit and the raven, and gets an\r\nuncertain and precarious living, and earns it.  He seems to subsist\r\nalmost wholly on the carcases of oxen, mules and horses that have dropped\r\nout of emigrant trains and died, and upon windfalls of carrion, and\r\noccasional legacies of offal bequeathed to him by white men who have been\r\nopulent enough to have something better to butcher than condemned army\r\nbacon.\r\n\r\nHe will eat anything in the world that his first cousins, the\r\ndesert-frequenting tribes of Indians will, and they will eat anything\r\nthey can bite.  It is a curious fact that these latter are the only\r\ncreatures known to history who will eat nitro-glycerine and ask for more\r\nif they survive.\r\n\r\nThe cayote of the deserts beyond the Rocky Mountains has a peculiarly\r\nhard time of it, owing to the fact that his relations, the Indians, are\r\njust as apt to be the first to detect a seductive scent on the desert\r\nbreeze, and follow the fragrance to the late ox it emanated from, as he\r\nis himself; and when this occurs he has to content himself with sitting\r\noff at a little distance watching those people strip off and dig out\r\neverything edible, and walk off with it.  Then he and the waiting ravens\r\nexplore the skeleton and polish the bones.  It is considered that the\r\ncayote, and the obscene bird, and the Indian of the desert, testify their\r\nblood kinship with each other in that they live together in the waste\r\nplaces of the earth on terms of perfect confidence and friendship, while\r\nhating all other creature and yearning to assist at their funerals.  He\r\ndoes not mind going a hundred miles to breakfast, and a hundred and fifty\r\nto dinner, because he is sure to have three or four days between meals,\r\nand he can just as well be traveling and looking at the scenery as lying\r\naround doing nothing and adding to the burdens of his parents.\r\n\r\nWe soon learned to recognize the sharp, vicious bark of the cayote as it\r\ncame across the murky plain at night to disturb our dreams among the\r\nmail-sacks; and remembering his forlorn aspect and his hard fortune, made\r\nshift to wish him the blessed novelty of a long day\'s good luck and a\r\nlimitless larder the morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nOur new conductor (just shipped) had been without sleep for twenty hours.\r\nSuch a thing was very frequent.  From St. Joseph, Missouri, to\r\nSacramento, California, by stage-coach, was nearly nineteen hundred\r\nmiles, and the trip was often made in fifteen days (the cars do it in\r\nfour and a half, now), but the time specified in the mail contracts, and\r\nrequired by the schedule, was eighteen or nineteen days, if I remember\r\nrightly.  This was to make fair allowance for winter storms and snows,\r\nand other unavoidable causes of detention.  The stage company had\r\neverything under strict discipline and good system.  Over each two\r\nhundred and fifty miles of road they placed an agent or superintendent,\r\nand invested him with great authority.  His beat or jurisdiction of two\r\nhundred and fifty miles was called a "division." He purchased horses,\r\nmules harness, and food for men and beasts, and distributed these things\r\namong his stage stations, from time to time, according to his judgment of\r\nwhat each station needed.  He erected station buildings and dug wells.\r\nHe attended to the paying of the station-keepers, hostlers, drivers and\r\nblacksmiths, and discharged them whenever he chose.  He was a very, very\r\ngreat man in his "division"--a kind of Grand Mogul, a Sultan of the\r\nIndies, in whose presence common men were modest of speech and manner,\r\nand in the glare of whose greatness even the dazzling stage-driver\r\ndwindled to a penny dip.  There were about eight of these kings, all\r\ntold, on the overland route.\r\n\r\nNext in rank and importance to the division-agent came the "conductor."\r\nHis beat was the same length as the agent\'s--two hundred and fifty miles.\r\nHe sat with the driver, and (when necessary) rode that fearful distance,\r\nnight and day, without other rest or sleep than what he could get perched\r\nthus on top of the flying vehicle.  Think of it!  He had absolute charge\r\nof the mails, express matter, passengers and stage, coach, until he\r\ndelivered them to the next conductor, and got his receipt for them.\r\n\r\nConsequently he had to be a man of intelligence, decision and\r\nconsiderable executive ability.  He was usually a quiet, pleasant man,\r\nwho attended closely to his duties, and was a good deal of a gentleman.\r\nIt was not absolutely necessary that the division-agent should be a\r\ngentleman, and occasionally he wasn\'t.  But he was always a general in\r\nadministrative ability, and a bull-dog in courage and determination\r\n--otherwise the chieftainship over the lawless underlings of the overland\r\nservice would never in any instance have been to him anything but an\r\nequivalent for a month of insolence and distress and a bullet and a\r\ncoffin at the end of it.  There were about sixteen or eighteen conductors\r\non the overland, for there was a daily stage each way, and a conductor on\r\nevery stage.\r\n\r\nNext in real and official rank and importance, after the conductor, came\r\nmy delight, the driver--next in real but not in apparent importance--for\r\nwe have seen that in the eyes of the common herd the driver was to the\r\nconductor as an admiral is to the captain of the flag-ship.  The driver\'s\r\nbeat was pretty long, and his sleeping-time at the stations pretty short,\r\nsometimes; and so, but for the grandeur of his position his would have\r\nbeen a sorry life, as well as a hard and a wearing one.  We took a new\r\ndriver every day or every night (for they drove backward and forward over\r\nthe same piece of road all the time), and therefore we never got as well\r\nacquainted with them as we did with the conductors; and besides, they\r\nwould have been above being familiar with such rubbish as passengers,\r\nanyhow, as a general thing.  Still, we were always eager to get a sight\r\nof each and every new driver as soon as the watch changed, for each and\r\nevery day we were either anxious to get rid of an unpleasant one, or\r\nloath to part with a driver we had learned to like and had come to be\r\nsociable and friendly with.  And so the first question we asked the\r\nconductor whenever we got to where we were to exchange drivers, was\r\nalways, "Which is him?"  The grammar was faulty, maybe, but we could not\r\nknow, then, that it would go into a book some day.  As long as everything\r\nwent smoothly, the overland driver was well enough situated, but if a\r\nfellow driver got sick suddenly it made trouble, for the coach must go\r\non, and so the potentate who was about to climb down and take a luxurious\r\nrest after his long night\'s siege in the midst of wind and rain and\r\ndarkness, had to stay where he was and do the sick man\'s work.  Once, in\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, when I found a driver sound asleep on the box, and\r\nthe mules going at the usual break-neck pace, the conductor said never\r\nmind him, there was no danger, and he was doing double duty--had driven\r\nseventy-five miles on one coach, and was now going back over it on this\r\nwithout rest or sleep.  A hundred and fifty miles of holding back of six\r\nvindictive mules and keeping them from climbing the trees!  It sounds\r\nincredible, but I remember the statement well enough.\r\n\r\nThe station-keepers, hostlers, etc., were low, rough characters, as\r\nalready described; and from western Nebraska to Nevada a considerable\r\nsprinkling of them might be fairly set down as outlaws--fugitives from\r\njustice, criminals whose best security was a section of country which was\r\nwithout law and without even the pretence of it.  When the\r\n"division-agent" issued an order to one of these parties he did it with\r\nthe full understanding that he might have to enforce it with a navy\r\nsix-shooter, and so he always went "fixed" to make things go along\r\nsmoothly.\r\n\r\nNow and then a division-agent was really obliged to shoot a hostler\r\nthrough the head to teach him some simple matter that he could have\r\ntaught him with a club if his circumstances and surroundings had been\r\ndifferent.  But they were snappy, able men, those division-agents, and\r\nwhen they tried to teach a subordinate anything, that subordinate\r\ngenerally "got it through his head."\r\n\r\nA great portion of this vast machinery--these hundreds of men and\r\ncoaches, and thousands of mules and horses--was in the hands of Mr. Ben\r\nHolliday.  All the western half of the business was in his hands.  This\r\nreminds me of an incident of Palestine travel which is pertinent here, so\r\nI will transfer it just in the language in which I find it set down in my\r\nHoly Land note-book:\r\n\r\n      No doubt everybody has heard of Ben Holliday--a man of prodigious\r\n      energy, who used to send mails and passengers flying across the\r\n      continent in his overland stage-coaches like a very whirlwind--two\r\n      thousand long miles in fifteen days and a half, by the watch!  But\r\n      this fragment of history is not about Ben Holliday, but about a\r\n      young New York boy by the name of Jack, who traveled with our small\r\n      party of pilgrims in the Holy Land (and who had traveled to\r\n      California in Mr. Holliday\'s overland coaches three years before,\r\n      and had by no means forgotten it or lost his gushing admiration of\r\n      Mr. H.) Aged nineteen.  Jack was a good boy--a good-hearted and\r\n      always well-meaning boy, who had been reared in the city of New\r\n      York, and although he was bright and knew a great many useful\r\n      things, his Scriptural education had been a good deal neglected--to\r\n      such a degree, indeed, that all Holy Land history was fresh and new\r\n      to him, and all Bible names mysteries that had never disturbed his\r\n      virgin ear.\r\n\r\n      Also in our party was an elderly pilgrim who was the reverse of\r\n      Jack, in that he was learned in the Scriptures and an enthusiast\r\n      concerning them.  He was our encyclopedia, and we were never tired\r\n      of listening to his speeches, nor he of making them.  He never\r\n      passed a celebrated locality, from Bashan to Bethlehem, without\r\n      illuminating it with an oration.  One day, when camped near the\r\n      ruins of Jericho, he burst forth with something like this:\r\n\r\n      "Jack, do you see that range of mountains over yonder that bounds\r\n      the Jordan valley?  The mountains of Moab, Jack!  Think of it, my\r\n      boy--the actual mountains of Moab--renowned in Scripture history!\r\n      We are actually standing face to face with those illustrious crags\r\n      and peaks--and for all we know" [dropping his voice impressively],\r\n      "our eyes may be resting at this very moment upon the spot WHERE\r\n      LIES THE MYSTERIOUS GRAVE OF MOSES!  Think of it, Jack!"\r\n\r\n      "Moses who?"  (falling inflection).\r\n\r\n      "Moses who!  Jack, you ought to be ashamed of yourself--you ought to\r\n      be ashamed of such criminal ignorance.  Why, Moses, the great guide,\r\n      soldier, poet, lawgiver of ancient Israel!  Jack, from this spot\r\n      where we stand, to Egypt, stretches a fearful desert three hundred\r\n      miles in extent--and across that desert that wonderful man brought\r\n      the children of Israel!--guiding them with unfailing sagacity for\r\n      forty years over the sandy desolation and among the obstructing\r\n      rocks and hills, and landed them at last, safe and sound, within\r\n      sight of this very spot; and where we now stand they entered the\r\n      Promised Land with anthems of rejoicing!  It was a wonderful,\r\n      wonderful thing to do, Jack!  Think of it!"\r\n\r\n      "Forty years?  Only three hundred miles?  Humph!  Ben Holliday would\r\n      have fetched them through in thirty-six hours!"\r\n\r\nThe boy meant no harm.  He did not know that he had said anything that\r\nwas wrong or irreverent.  And so no one scolded him or felt offended with\r\nhim--and nobody could but some ungenerous spirit incapable of excusing\r\nthe heedless blunders of a boy.\r\n\r\nAt noon on the fifth day out, we arrived at the "Crossing of the South\r\nPlatte," alias "Julesburg," alias "Overland City," four hundred and\r\nseventy miles from St. Joseph--the strangest, quaintest, funniest\r\nfrontier town that our untraveled eyes had ever stared at and been\r\nastonished with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nIt did seem strange enough to see a town again after what appeared to us\r\nsuch a long acquaintance with deep, still, almost lifeless and houseless\r\nsolitude!  We tumbled out into the busy street feeling like meteoric\r\npeople crumbled off the corner of some other world, and wakened up\r\nsuddenly in this.  For an hour we took as much interest in Overland City\r\nas if we had never seen a town before.  The reason we had an hour to\r\nspare was because we had to change our stage (for a less sumptuous\r\naffair, called a "mud-wagon") and transfer our freight of mails.\r\n\r\nPresently we got under way again.  We came to the shallow, yellow, muddy\r\nSouth Platte, with its low banks and its scattering flat sand-bars and\r\npigmy islands--a melancholy stream straggling through the centre of the\r\nenormous flat plain, and only saved from being impossible to find with\r\nthe naked eye by its sentinel rank of scattering trees standing on either\r\nbank.  The Platte was "up," they said--which made me wish I could see it\r\nwhen it was down, if it could look any sicker and sorrier.  They said it\r\nwas a dangerous stream to cross, now, because its quicksands were liable\r\nto swallow up horses, coach and passengers if an attempt was made to ford\r\nit.  But the mails had to go, and we made the attempt.  Once or twice in\r\nmidstream the wheels sunk into the yielding sands so threateningly that\r\nwe half believed we had dreaded and avoided the sea all our lives to be\r\nshipwrecked in a "mud-wagon" in the middle of a desert at last.  But we\r\ndragged through and sped away toward the setting sun.\r\n\r\nNext morning, just before dawn, when about five hundred and fifty miles\r\nfrom St. Joseph, our mud-wagon broke down.  We were to be delayed five or\r\nsix hours, and therefore we took horses, by invitation, and joined a\r\nparty who were just starting on a buffalo hunt.  It was noble sport\r\ngalloping over the plain in the dewy freshness of the morning, but our\r\npart of the hunt ended in disaster and disgrace, for a wounded buffalo\r\nbull chased the passenger Bemis nearly two miles, and then he forsook his\r\nhorse and took to a lone tree.  He was very sullen about the matter for\r\nsome twenty-four hours, but at last he began to soften little by little,\r\nand finally he said:\r\n\r\n"Well, it was not funny, and there was no sense in those gawks making\r\nthemselves so facetious over it.  I tell you I was angry in earnest for\r\nawhile.  I should have shot that long gangly lubber they called Hank, if\r\nI could have done it without crippling six or seven other people--but of\r\ncourse I couldn\'t, the old \'Allen\'s\' so confounded comprehensive.  I wish\r\nthose loafers had been up in the tree; they wouldn\'t have wanted to laugh\r\nso.  If I had had a horse worth a cent--but no, the minute he saw that\r\nbuffalo bull wheel on him and give a bellow, he raised straight up in the\r\nair and stood on his heels.  The saddle began to slip, and I took him\r\nround the neck and laid close to him, and began to pray.  Then he came\r\ndown and stood up on the other end awhile, and the bull actually stopped\r\npawing sand and bellowing to contemplate the inhuman spectacle.\r\n\r\n"Then the bull made a pass at him and uttered a bellow that sounded\r\nperfectly frightful, it was so close to me, and that seemed to literally\r\nprostrate my horse\'s reason, and make a raving distracted maniac of him,\r\nand I wish I may die if he didn\'t stand on his head for a quarter of a\r\nminute and shed tears.  He was absolutely out of his mind--he was, as\r\nsure as truth itself, and he really didn\'t know what he was doing.  Then\r\nthe bull came charging at us, and my horse dropped down on all fours and\r\ntook a fresh start--and then for the next ten minutes he would actually\r\nthrow one hand-spring after another so fast that the bull began to get\r\nunsettled, too, and didn\'t know where to start in--and so he stood there\r\nsneezing, and shovelling dust over his back, and bellowing every now and\r\nthen, and thinking he had got a fifteen-hundred dollar circus horse for\r\nbreakfast, certain.  Well, I was first out on his neck--the horse\'s, not\r\nthe bull\'s--and then underneath, and next on his rump, and sometimes head\r\nup, and sometimes heels--but I tell you it seemed solemn and awful to be\r\nripping and tearing and carrying on so in the presence of death, as you\r\nmight say.  Pretty soon the bull made a snatch for us and brought away\r\nsome of my horse\'s tail (I suppose, but do not know, being pretty busy at\r\nthe time), but something made him hungry for solitude and suggested to\r\nhim to get up and hunt for it.\r\n\r\n"And then you ought to have seen that spider legged old skeleton go! and\r\nyou ought to have seen the bull cut out after him, too--head down, tongue\r\nout, tail up, bellowing like everything, and actually mowing down the\r\nweeds, and tearing up the earth, and boosting up the sand like a\r\nwhirlwind!  By George, it was a hot race!  I and the saddle were back on\r\nthe rump, and I had the bridle in my teeth and holding on to the pommel\r\nwith both hands.  First we left the dogs behind; then we passed a jackass\r\nrabbit; then we overtook a cayote, and were gaining on an antelope when\r\nthe rotten girth let go and threw me about thirty yards off to the left,\r\nand as the saddle went down over the horse\'s rump he gave it a lift with\r\nhis heels that sent it more than four hundred yards up in the air, I wish\r\nI may die in a minute if he didn\'t.  I fell at the foot of the only\r\nsolitary tree there was in nine counties adjacent (as any creature could\r\nsee with the naked eye), and the next second I had hold of the bark with\r\nfour sets of nails and my teeth, and the next second after that I was\r\nastraddle of the main limb and blaspheming my luck in a way that made my\r\nbreath smell of brimstone.  I had the bull, now, if he did not think of\r\none thing.  But that one thing I dreaded.  I dreaded it very seriously.\r\nThere was a possibility that the bull might not think of it, but there\r\nwere greater chances that he would.  I made up my mind what I would do in\r\ncase he did.  It was a little over forty feet to the ground from where I\r\nsat.  I cautiously unwound the lariat from the pommel of my saddle----"\r\n\r\n"Your saddle?  Did you take your saddle up in the tree with you?"\r\n\r\n"Take it up in the tree with me?  Why, how you talk.  Of course I didn\'t.\r\nNo man could do that.  It fell in the tree when it came down."\r\n\r\n"Oh--exactly."\r\n\r\n"Certainly.  I unwound the lariat, and fastened one end of it to the\r\nlimb.  It was the very best green raw-hide, and capable of sustaining\r\ntons.  I made a slip-noose in the other end, and then hung it down to see\r\nthe length.  It reached down twenty-two feet--half way to the ground.\r\nI then loaded every barrel of the Allen with a double charge.  I felt\r\nsatisfied.  I said to myself, if he never thinks of that one thing that I\r\ndread, all right--but if he does, all right anyhow--I am fixed for him.\r\nBut don\'t you know that the very thing a man dreads is the thing that\r\nalways happens?  Indeed it is so.  I watched the bull, now, with anxiety\r\n--anxiety which no one can conceive of who has not been in such a\r\nsituation and felt that at any moment death might come.  Presently a\r\nthought came into the bull\'s eye.  I knew it! said I--if my nerve fails\r\nnow, I am lost.  Sure enough, it was just as I had dreaded, he started in\r\nto climb the tree----"\r\n\r\n"What, the bull?"\r\n\r\n"Of course--who else?"\r\n\r\n"But a bull can\'t climb a tree."\r\n\r\n"He can\'t, can\'t he?  Since you know so much about it, did you ever see a\r\nbull try?"\r\n\r\n"No!  I never dreamt of such a thing."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, what is the use of your talking that way, then?  Because you\r\nnever saw a thing done, is that any reason why it can\'t be done?"\r\n\r\n"Well, all right--go on.  What did you do?"\r\n\r\n"The bull started up, and got along well for about ten feet, then slipped\r\nand slid back.  I breathed easier.  He tried it again--got up a little\r\nhigher--slipped again.  But he came at it once more, and this time he was\r\ncareful.  He got gradually higher and higher, and my spirits went down\r\nmore and more.  Up he came--an inch at a time--with his eyes hot, and his\r\ntongue hanging out.  Higher and higher--hitched his foot over the stump\r\nof a limb, and looked up, as much as to say, \'You are my meat, friend.\'\r\nUp again--higher and higher, and getting more excited the closer he got.\r\nHe was within ten feet of me!  I took a long breath,--and then said I,\r\n\'It is now or never.\'  I had the coil of the lariat all ready; I paid it\r\nout slowly, till it hung right over his head; all of a sudden I let go of\r\nthe slack, and the slipnoose fell fairly round his neck!  Quicker than\r\nlightning I out with the Allen and let him have it in the face.  It was\r\nan awful roar, and must have scared the bull out of his senses.  When the\r\nsmoke cleared away, there he was, dangling in the air, twenty foot from\r\nthe ground, and going out of one convulsion into another faster than you\r\ncould count!  I didn\'t stop to count, anyhow--I shinned down the tree and\r\nshot for home."\r\n\r\n"Bemis, is all that true, just as you have stated it?"\r\n\r\n"I wish I may rot in my tracks and die the death of a dog if it isn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Well, we can\'t refuse to believe it, and we don\'t.  But if there were\r\nsome proofs----"\r\n\r\n"Proofs!  Did I bring back my lariat?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Did I bring back my horse?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Did you ever see the bull again?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, what more do you want?  I never saw anybody as particular as\r\nyou are about a little thing like that."\r\n\r\nI made up my mind that if this man was not a liar he only missed it by\r\nthe skin of his teeth.  This episode reminds me of an incident of my\r\nbrief sojourn in Siam, years afterward.  The European citizens of a town\r\nin the neighborhood of Bangkok had a prodigy among them by the name of\r\nEckert, an Englishman--a person famous for the number, ingenuity and\r\nimposing magnitude of his lies.  They were always repeating his most\r\ncelebrated falsehoods, and always trying to "draw him out" before\r\nstrangers; but they seldom succeeded.  Twice he was invited to the house\r\nwhere I was visiting, but nothing could seduce him into a specimen lie.\r\nOne day a planter named Bascom, an influential man, and a proud and\r\nsometimes irascible one, invited me to ride over with him and call on\r\nEckert.  As we jogged along, said he:\r\n\r\n"Now, do you know where the fault lies?  It lies in putting Eckert on his\r\nguard.  The minute the boys go to pumping at Eckert he knows perfectly\r\nwell what they are after, and of course he shuts up his shell.  Anybody\r\nmight know he would.  But when we get there, we must play him finer than\r\nthat.  Let him shape the conversation to suit himself--let him drop it or\r\nchange it whenever he wants to.  Let him see that nobody is trying to\r\ndraw him out.  Just let him have his own way.  He will soon forget\r\nhimself and begin to grind out lies like a mill.  Don\'t get impatient\r\n--just keep quiet, and let me play him.  I will make him lie.  It does seem\r\nto me that the boys must be blind to overlook such an obvious and simple\r\ntrick as that."\r\n\r\nEckert received us heartily--a pleasant-spoken, gentle-mannered creature.\r\nWe sat in the veranda an hour, sipping English ale, and talking about the\r\nking, and the sacred white elephant, the Sleeping Idol, and all manner of\r\nthings; and I noticed that my comrade never led the conversation himself\r\nor shaped it, but simply followed Eckert\'s lead, and betrayed no\r\nsolicitude and no anxiety about anything.  The effect was shortly\r\nperceptible.  Eckert began to grow communicative; he grew more and more\r\nat his ease, and more and more talkative and sociable.  Another hour\r\npassed in the same way, and then all of a sudden Eckert said:\r\n\r\n"Oh, by the way!  I came near forgetting.  I have got a thing here to\r\nastonish you.  Such a thing as neither you nor any other man ever heard\r\nof--I\'ve got a cat that will eat cocoanut!  Common green cocoanut--and\r\nnot only eat the meat, but drink the milk.  It is so--I\'ll swear to it."\r\n\r\nA quick glance from Bascom--a glance that I understood--then:\r\n\r\n"Why, bless my soul, I never heard of such a thing.  Man, it is\r\nimpossible."\r\n\r\n"I knew you would say it.  I\'ll fetch the cat."\r\n\r\nHe went in the house.  Bascom said:\r\n\r\n"There--what did I tell you?  Now, that is the way to handle Eckert.  You\r\nsee, I have petted him along patiently, and put his suspicions to sleep.\r\nI am glad we came.  You tell the boys about it when you go back.  Cat eat\r\na cocoanut--oh, my!  Now, that is just his way, exactly--he will tell the\r\nabsurdest lie, and trust to luck to get out of it again.\r\n\r\n"Cat eat a cocoanut--the innocent fool!"\r\n\r\nEckert approached with his cat, sure enough.\r\n\r\nBascom smiled.  Said he:\r\n\r\n"I\'ll hold the cat--you bring a cocoanut."\r\n\r\nEckert split one open, and chopped up some pieces.  Bascom smuggled a\r\nwink to me, and proffered a slice of the fruit to puss.  She snatched it,\r\nswallowed it ravenously, and asked for more!\r\n\r\nWe rode our two miles in silence, and wide apart.  At least I was silent,\r\nthough Bascom cuffed his horse and cursed him a good deal,\r\nnotwithstanding the horse was behaving well enough.  When I branched off\r\nhomeward, Bascom said:\r\n\r\n"Keep the horse till morning.  And--you need not speak of this\r\n--foolishness to the boys."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nIn a little while all interest was taken up in stretching our necks and\r\nwatching for the "pony-rider"--the fleet messenger who sped across the\r\ncontinent from St. Joe to Sacramento, carrying letters nineteen hundred\r\nmiles in eight days!  Think of that for perishable horse and human flesh\r\nand blood to do!  The pony-rider was usually a little bit of a man,\r\nbrimful of spirit and endurance.  No matter what time of the day or night\r\nhis watch came on, and no matter whether it was winter or summer,\r\nraining, snowing, hailing, or sleeting, or whether his "beat" was a level\r\nstraight road or a crazy trail over mountain crags and precipices, or\r\nwhether it led through peaceful regions or regions that swarmed with\r\nhostile Indians, he must be always ready to leap into the saddle and be\r\noff like the wind!  There was no idling-time for a pony-rider on duty.\r\nHe rode fifty miles without stopping, by daylight, moonlight, starlight,\r\nor through the blackness of darkness--just as it happened.  He rode a\r\nsplendid horse that was born for a racer and fed and lodged like a\r\ngentleman; kept him at his utmost speed for ten miles, and then, as he\r\ncame crashing up to the station where stood two men holding fast a fresh,\r\nimpatient steed, the transfer of rider and mail-bag was made in the\r\ntwinkling of an eye, and away flew the eager pair and were out of sight\r\nbefore the spectator could get hardly the ghost of a look.  Both rider\r\nand horse went "flying light." The rider\'s dress was thin, and fitted\r\nclose; he wore a "round-about," and a skull-cap, and tucked his\r\npantaloons into his boot-tops like a race-rider.  He carried no arms--he\r\ncarried nothing that was not absolutely necessary, for even the postage\r\non his literary freight was worth five dollars a letter.\r\n\r\nHe got but little frivolous correspondence to carry--his bag had business\r\nletters in it, mostly.  His horse was stripped of all unnecessary weight,\r\ntoo.  He wore a little wafer of a racing-saddle, and no visible blanket.\r\nHe wore light shoes, or none at all.  The little flat mail-pockets\r\nstrapped under the rider\'s thighs would each hold about the bulk of a\r\nchild\'s primer.  They held many and many an important business chapter\r\nand newspaper letter, but these were written on paper as airy and thin as\r\ngold-leaf, nearly, and thus bulk and weight were economized.  The\r\nstage-coach traveled about a hundred to a hundred and twenty-five miles\r\na day (twenty-four hours), the pony-rider about two hundred and fifty.\r\nThere were about eighty pony-riders in the saddle all the time, night and\r\nday, stretching in a long, scattering procession from Missouri to\r\nCalifornia, forty flying eastward, and forty toward the west, and among\r\nthem making four hundred gallant horses earn a stirring livelihood and\r\nsee a deal of scenery every single day in the year.\r\n\r\nWe had had a consuming desire, from the beginning, to see a pony-rider,\r\nbut somehow or other all that passed us and all that met us managed to\r\nstreak by in the night, and so we heard only a whiz and a hail, and the\r\nswift phantom of the desert was gone before we could get our heads out of\r\nthe windows.  But now we were expecting one along every moment, and would\r\nsee him in broad daylight.  Presently the driver exclaims:\r\n\r\n"HERE HE COMES!"\r\n\r\nEvery neck is stretched further, and every eye strained wider.  Away\r\nacross the endless dead level of the prairie a black speck appears\r\nagainst the sky, and it is plain that it moves.  Well, I should think so!\r\n\r\nIn a second or two it becomes a horse and rider, rising and falling,\r\nrising and falling--sweeping toward us nearer and nearer--growing more\r\nand more distinct, more and more sharply defined--nearer and still\r\nnearer, and the flutter of the hoofs comes faintly to the ear--another\r\ninstant a whoop and a hurrah from our upper deck, a wave of the rider\'s\r\nhand, but no reply, and man and horse burst past our excited faces, and\r\ngo winging away like a belated fragment of a storm!\r\n\r\nSo sudden is it all, and so like a flash of unreal fancy, that but for\r\nthe flake of white foam left quivering and perishing on a mail-sack after\r\nthe vision had flashed by and disappeared, we might have doubted whether\r\nwe had seen any actual horse and man at all, maybe.\r\n\r\nWe rattled through Scott\'s Bluffs Pass, by and by.  It was along here\r\nsomewhere that we first came across genuine and unmistakable alkali water\r\nin the road, and we cordially hailed it as a first-class curiosity, and a\r\nthing to be mentioned with eclat in letters to the ignorant at home.\r\nThis water gave the road a soapy appearance, and in many places the\r\nground looked as if it had been whitewashed.  I think the strange alkali\r\nwater excited us as much as any wonder we had come upon yet, and I know\r\nwe felt very complacent and conceited, and better satisfied with life\r\nafter we had added it to our list of things which we had seen and some\r\nother people had not.  In a small way we were the same sort of simpletons\r\nas those who climb unnecessarily the perilous peaks of Mont Blanc and the\r\nMatterhorn, and derive no pleasure from it except the reflection that it\r\nisn\'t a common experience.  But once in a while one of those parties\r\ntrips and comes darting down the long mountain-crags in a sitting\r\nposture, making the crusted snow smoke behind him, flitting from bench to\r\nbench, and from terrace to terrace, jarring the earth where he strikes,\r\nand still glancing and flitting on again, sticking an iceberg into\r\nhimself every now and then, and tearing his clothes, snatching at things\r\nto save himself, taking hold of trees and fetching them along with him,\r\nroots and all, starting little rocks now and then, then big boulders,\r\nthen acres of ice and snow and patches of forest, gathering and still\r\ngathering as he goes, adding and still adding to his massed and sweeping\r\ngrandeur as he nears a three thousand-foot precipice, till at last he\r\nwaves his hat magnificently and rides into eternity on the back of a\r\nraging and tossing avalanche!\r\n\r\nThis is all very fine, but let us not be carried away by excitement, but\r\nask calmly, how does this person feel about it in his cooler moments next\r\nday, with six or seven thousand feet of snow and stuff on top of him?\r\n\r\nWe crossed the sand hills near the scene of the Indian mail robbery and\r\nmassacre of 1856, wherein the driver and conductor perished, and also all\r\nthe passengers but one, it was supposed; but this must have been a\r\nmistake, for at different times afterward on the Pacific coast I was\r\npersonally acquainted with a hundred and thirty-three or four people who\r\nwere wounded during that massacre, and barely escaped with their lives.\r\nThere was no doubt of the truth of it--I had it from their own lips.  One\r\nof these parties told me that he kept coming across arrow-heads in his\r\nsystem for nearly seven years after the massacre; and another of them\r\ntold me that he was struck so literally full of arrows that after the\r\nIndians were gone and he could raise up and examine himself, he could not\r\nrestrain his tears, for his clothes were completely ruined.\r\n\r\nThe most trustworthy tradition avers, however, that only one man, a\r\nperson named Babbitt, survived the massacre, and he was desperately\r\nwounded.  He dragged himself on his hands and knee (for one leg was\r\nbroken) to a station several miles away.  He did it during portions of\r\ntwo nights, lying concealed one day and part of another, and for more\r\nthan forty hours suffering unimaginable anguish from hunger, thirst and\r\nbodily pain.  The Indians robbed the coach of everything it contained,\r\nincluding quite an amount of treasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nWe passed Fort Laramie in the night, and on the seventh morning out we\r\nfound ourselves in the Black Hills, with Laramie Peak at our elbow\r\n(apparently) looming vast and solitary--a deep, dark, rich indigo blue in\r\nhue, so portentously did the old colossus frown under his beetling brows\r\nof storm-cloud.  He was thirty or forty miles away, in reality, but he\r\nonly seemed removed a little beyond the low ridge at our right.  We\r\nbreakfasted at Horse-Shoe Station, six hundred and seventy-six miles out\r\nfrom St. Joseph.  We had now reached a hostile Indian country, and during\r\nthe afternoon we passed Laparelle Station, and enjoyed great discomfort\r\nall the time we were in the neighborhood, being aware that many of the\r\ntrees we dashed by at arm\'s length concealed a lurking Indian or two.\r\nDuring the preceding night an ambushed savage had sent a bullet through\r\nthe pony-rider\'s jacket, but he had ridden on, just the same, because\r\npony-riders were not allowed to stop and inquire into such things except\r\nwhen killed.  As long as they had life enough left in them they had to\r\nstick to the horse and ride, even if the Indians had been waiting for\r\nthem a week, and were entirely out of patience.  About two hours and a\r\nhalf before we arrived at Laparelle Station, the keeper in charge of it\r\nhad fired four times at an Indian, but he said with an injured air that\r\nthe Indian had "skipped around so\'s to spile everything--and ammunition\'s\r\nblamed skurse, too." The most natural inference conveyed by his manner of\r\nspeaking was, that in "skipping around," the Indian had taken an unfair\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe coach we were in had a neat hole through its front--a reminiscence of\r\nits last trip through this region.  The bullet that made it wounded the\r\ndriver slightly, but he did not mind it much.  He said the place to keep\r\na man "huffy" was down on the Southern Overland, among the Apaches,\r\nbefore the company moved the stage line up on the northern route.  He\r\nsaid the Apaches used to annoy him all the time down there, and that he\r\ncame as near as anything to starving to death in the midst of abundance,\r\nbecause they kept him so leaky with bullet holes that he "couldn\'t hold\r\nhis vittles."\r\n\r\nThis person\'s statement were not generally believed.\r\n\r\nWe shut the blinds down very tightly that first night in the hostile\r\nIndian country, and lay on our arms.  We slept on them some, but most of\r\nthe time we only lay on them.  We did not talk much, but kept quiet and\r\nlistened.  It was an inky-black night, and occasionally rainy.  We were\r\namong woods and rocks, hills and gorges--so shut in, in fact, that when\r\nwe peeped through a chink in a curtain, we could discern nothing.  The\r\ndriver and conductor on top were still, too, or only spoke at long\r\nintervals, in low tones, as is the way of men in the midst of invisible\r\ndangers.  We listened to rain-drops pattering on the roof; and the\r\ngrinding of the wheels through the muddy gravel; and the low wailing of\r\nthe wind; and all the time we had that absurd sense upon us, inseparable\r\nfrom travel at night in a close-curtained vehicle, the sense of remaining\r\nperfectly still in one place, notwithstanding the jolting and swaying of\r\nthe vehicle, the trampling of the horses, and the grinding of the wheels.\r\nWe listened a long time, with intent faculties and bated breath; every\r\ntime one of us would relax, and draw a long sigh of relief and start to\r\nsay something, a comrade would be sure to utter a sudden "Hark!" and\r\ninstantly the experimenter was rigid and listening again.  So the\r\ntiresome minutes and decades of minutes dragged away, until at last our\r\ntense forms filmed over with a dulled consciousness, and we slept, if one\r\nmight call such a condition by so strong a name--for it was a sleep set\r\nwith a hair-trigger.  It was a sleep seething and teeming with a weird\r\nand distressful confusion of shreds and fag-ends of dreams--a sleep that\r\nwas a chaos.  Presently, dreams and sleep and the sullen hush of the\r\nnight were startled by a ringing report, and cloven by such a long, wild,\r\nagonizing shriek!  Then we heard--ten steps from the stage--\r\n\r\n"Help!  help!  help!" [It was our driver\'s voice.]\r\n\r\n"Kill him!  Kill him like a dog!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m being murdered!  Will no man lend me a pistol?"\r\n\r\n"Look out! head him off! head him off!"\r\n\r\n[Two pistol shots; a confusion of voices and the trampling of many feet,\r\nas if a crowd were closing and surging together around some object;\r\nseveral heavy, dull blows, as with a club; a voice that said appealingly,\r\n"Don\'t, gentlemen, please don\'t--I\'m a dead man!" Then a fainter groan,\r\nand another blow, and away sped the stage into the darkness, and left the\r\ngrisly mystery behind us.]\r\n\r\nWhat a startle it was!  Eight seconds would amply cover the time it\r\noccupied--maybe even five would do it.  We only had time to plunge at a\r\ncurtain and unbuckle and unbutton part of it in an awkward and hindering\r\nflurry, when our whip cracked sharply overhead, and we went rumbling and\r\nthundering away, down a mountain "grade."\r\n\r\nWe fed on that mystery the rest of the night--what was left of it, for it\r\nwas waning fast.  It had to remain a present mystery, for all we could\r\nget from the conductor in answer to our hails was something that sounded,\r\nthrough the clatter of the wheels, like "Tell you in the morning!"\r\n\r\nSo we lit our pipes and opened the corner of a curtain for a chimney, and\r\nlay there in the dark, listening to each other\'s story of how he first\r\nfelt and how many thousand Indians he first thought had hurled themselves\r\nupon us, and what his remembrance of the subsequent sounds was, and the\r\norder of their occurrence.  And we theorized, too, but there was never a\r\ntheory that would account for our driver\'s voice being out there, nor yet\r\naccount for his Indian murderers talking such good English, if they were\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nSo we chatted and smoked the rest of the night comfortably away, our\r\nboding anxiety being somehow marvelously dissipated by the real presence\r\nof something to be anxious about.\r\n\r\nWe never did get much satisfaction about that dark occurrence.  All that\r\nwe could make out of the odds and ends of the information we gathered in\r\nthe morning, was that the disturbance occurred at a station; that we\r\nchanged drivers there, and that the driver that got off there had been\r\ntalking roughly about some of the outlaws that infested the region ("for\r\nthere wasn\'t a man around there but had a price on his head and didn\'t\r\ndare show himself in the settlements," the conductor said); he had talked\r\nroughly about these characters, and ought to have "drove up there with\r\nhis pistol cocked and ready on the seat alongside of him, and begun\r\nbusiness himself, because any softy would know they would be laying for\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nThat was all we could gather, and we could see that neither the conductor\r\nnor the new driver were much concerned about the matter.  They plainly\r\nhad little respect for a man who would deliver offensive opinions of\r\npeople and then be so simple as to come into their presence unprepared to\r\n"back his judgment," as they pleasantly phrased the killing of any\r\nfellow-being who did not like said opinions.  And likewise they plainly\r\nhad a contempt for the man\'s poor discretion in venturing to rouse the\r\nwrath of such utterly reckless wild beasts as those outlaws--and the\r\nconductor added:\r\n\r\n"I tell you it\'s as much as Slade himself want to do!"\r\n\r\nThis remark created an entire revolution in my curiosity.  I cared\r\nnothing now about the Indians, and even lost interest in the murdered\r\ndriver.  There was such magic in that name, SLADE!  Day or night, now, I\r\nstood always ready to drop any subject in hand, to listen to something\r\nnew about Slade and his ghastly exploits.  Even before we got to Overland\r\nCity, we had begun to hear about Slade and his "division" (for he was a\r\n"division-agent") on the Overland; and from the hour we had left Overland\r\nCity we had heard drivers and conductors talk about only three things\r\n--"Californy," the Nevada silver mines, and this desperado Slade.  And a\r\ndeal the most of the talk was about Slade.  We had gradually come to have\r\na realizing sense of the fact that Slade was a man whose heart and hands\r\nand soul were steeped in the blood of offenders against his dignity; a\r\nman who awfully avenged all injuries, affront, insults or slights, of\r\nwhatever kind--on the spot if he could, years afterward if lack of\r\nearlier opportunity compelled it; a man whose hate tortured him day and\r\nnight till vengeance appeased it--and not an ordinary vengeance either,\r\nbut his enemy\'s absolute death--nothing less; a man whose face would\r\nlight up with a terrible joy when he surprised a foe and had him at a\r\ndisadvantage.  A high and efficient servant of the Overland, an outlaw\r\namong outlaws and yet their relentless scourge, Slade was at once the\r\nmost bloody, the most dangerous and the most valuable citizen that\r\ninhabited the savage fastnesses of the mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nReally and truly, two thirds of the talk of drivers and conductors had\r\nbeen about this man Slade, ever since the day before we reached\r\nJulesburg.  In order that the eastern reader may have a clear conception\r\nof what a Rocky Mountain desperado is, in his highest state of\r\ndevelopment, I will reduce all this mass of overland gossip to one\r\nstraightforward narrative, and present it in the following shape:\r\n\r\nSlade was born in Illinois, of good parentage.  At about twenty-six years\r\nof age he killed a man in a quarrel and fled the country.  At St. Joseph,\r\nMissouri, he joined one of the early California-bound emigrant trains,\r\nand was given the post of train-master.  One day on the plains he had an\r\nangry dispute with one of his wagon-drivers, and both drew their\r\nrevolvers.  But the driver was the quicker artist, and had his weapon\r\ncocked first.  So Slade said it was a pity to waste life on so small a\r\nmatter, and proposed that the pistols be thrown on the ground and the\r\nquarrel settled by a fist-fight.  The unsuspecting driver agreed, and\r\nthrew down his pistol--whereupon Slade laughed at his simplicity, and\r\nshot him dead!\r\n\r\nHe made his escape, and lived a wild life for awhile, dividing his time\r\nbetween fighting Indians and avoiding an Illinois sheriff, who had been\r\nsent to arrest him for his first murder.  It is said that in one Indian\r\nbattle he killed three savages with his own hand, and afterward cut their\r\nears off and sent them, with his compliments, to the chief of the tribe.\r\n\r\nSlade soon gained a name for fearless resolution, and this was sufficient\r\nmerit to procure for him the important post of overland division-agent at\r\nJulesburg, in place of Mr. Jules, removed.  For some time previously, the\r\ncompany\'s horses had been frequently stolen, and the coaches delayed, by\r\ngangs of outlaws, who were wont to laugh at the idea of any man\'s having\r\nthe temerity to resent such outrages.  Slade resented them promptly.\r\n\r\nThe outlaws soon found that the new agent was a man who did not fear\r\nanything that breathed the breath of life.  He made short work of all\r\noffenders.  The result was that delays ceased, the company\'s property was\r\nlet alone, and no matter what happened or who suffered, Slade\'s coaches\r\nwent through, every time!  True, in order to bring about this wholesome\r\nchange, Slade had to kill several men--some say three, others say four,\r\nand others six--but the world was the richer for their loss.  The first\r\nprominent difficulty he had was with the ex-agent Jules, who bore the\r\nreputation of being a reckless and desperate man himself.  Jules hated\r\nSlade for supplanting him, and a good fair occasion for a fight was all\r\nhe was waiting for.  By and by Slade dared to employ a man whom Jules had\r\nonce discharged.  Next, Slade seized a team of stage-horses which he\r\naccused Jules of having driven off and hidden somewhere for his own use.\r\nWar was declared, and for a day or two the two men walked warily about\r\nthe streets, seeking each other, Jules armed with a double-barreled shot\r\ngun, and Slade with his history-creating revolver.  Finally, as Slade\r\nstepped into a store Jules poured the contents of his gun into him from\r\nbehind the door.  Slade was plucky, and Jules got several bad pistol\r\nwounds in return.\r\n\r\nThen both men fell, and were carried to their respective lodgings, both\r\nswearing that better aim should do deadlier work next time.  Both were\r\nbedridden a long time, but Jules got to his feet first, and gathering his\r\npossessions together, packed them on a couple of mules, and fled to the\r\nRocky Mountains to gather strength in safety against the day of\r\nreckoning.  For many months he was not seen or heard of, and was\r\ngradually dropped out of the remembrance of all save Slade himself.  But\r\nSlade was not the man to forget him.  On the contrary, common report said\r\nthat Slade kept a reward standing for his capture, dead or alive!\r\n\r\nAfter awhile, seeing that Slade\'s energetic administration had restored\r\npeace and order to one of the worst divisions of the road, the overland\r\nstage company transferred him to the Rocky Ridge division in the Rocky\r\nMountains, to see if he could perform a like miracle there.  It was the\r\nvery paradise of outlaws and desperadoes.  There was absolutely no\r\nsemblance of law there.  Violence was the rule.  Force was the only\r\nrecognized authority.  The commonest misunderstandings were settled on\r\nthe spot with the revolver or the knife.  Murders were done in open day,\r\nand with sparkling frequency, and nobody thought of inquiring into them.\r\nIt was considered that the parties who did the killing had their private\r\nreasons for it; for other people to meddle would have been looked upon as\r\nindelicate.  After a murder, all that Rocky Mountain etiquette required\r\nof a spectator was, that he should help the gentleman bury his game\r\n--otherwise his churlishness would surely be remembered against him the\r\nfirst time he killed a man himself and needed a neighborly turn in\r\ninterring him.\r\n\r\nSlade took up his residence sweetly and peacefully in the midst of this\r\nhive of horse-thieves and assassins, and the very first time one of them\r\naired his insolent swaggerings in his presence he shot him dead!  He\r\nbegan a raid on the outlaws, and in a singularly short space of time he\r\nhad completely stopped their depredations on the stage stock, recovered a\r\nlarge number of stolen horses, killed several of the worst desperadoes of\r\nthe district, and gained such a dread ascendancy over the rest that they\r\nrespected him, admired him, feared him, obeyed him!  He wrought the same\r\nmarvelous change in the ways of the community that had marked his\r\nadministration at Overland City.  He captured two men who had stolen\r\noverland stock, and with his own hands he hanged them.  He was supreme\r\njudge in his district, and he was jury and executioner likewise--and not\r\nonly in the case of offences against his employers, but against passing\r\nemigrants as well.  On one occasion some emigrants had their stock lost\r\nor stolen, and told Slade, who chanced to visit their camp.  With a\r\nsingle companion he rode to a ranch, the owners of which he suspected,\r\nand opening the door, commenced firing, killing three, and wounding the\r\nfourth.\r\n\r\nFrom a bloodthirstily interesting little Montana book.--["The Vigilantes\r\nof Montana," by Prof. Thos. J. Dimsdale.]--I take this paragraph:\r\n\r\n      "While on the road, Slade held absolute sway.  He would ride down to\r\n      a station, get into a quarrel, turn the house out of windows, and\r\n      maltreat the occupants most cruelly.  The unfortunates had no means\r\n      of redress, and were compelled to recuperate as best they could."\r\n\r\nOn one of these occasions, it is said he killed the father of the fine\r\nlittle half-breed boy Jemmy, whom he adopted, and who lived with his\r\nwidow after his execution.  Stories of Slade\'s hanging men, and of\r\ninnumerable assaults, shootings, stabbings and beatings, in which he was\r\na principal actor, form part of the legends of the stage line.  As for\r\nminor quarrels and shootings, it is absolutely certain that a minute\r\nhistory of Slade\'s life would be one long record of such practices.\r\n\r\nSlade was a matchless marksman with a navy revolver.  The legends say\r\nthat one morning at Rocky Ridge, when he was feeling comfortable, he saw\r\na man approaching who had offended him some days before--observe the fine\r\nmemory he had for matters like that--and, "Gentlemen," said Slade,\r\ndrawing, "it is a good twenty-yard shot--I\'ll clip the third button on\r\nhis coat!"  Which he did.  The bystanders all admired it.  And they all\r\nattended the funeral, too.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion a man who kept a little whisky-shelf at the station did\r\nsomething which angered Slade--and went and made his will.  A day or two\r\nafterward Slade came in and called for some brandy.  The man reached\r\nunder the counter (ostensibly to get a bottle--possibly to get something\r\nelse), but Slade smiled upon him that peculiarly bland and satisfied\r\nsmile of his which the neighbors had long ago learned to recognize as a\r\ndeath-warrant in disguise, and told him to "none of that!--pass out the\r\nhigh-priced article."  So the poor bar-keeper had to turn his back and\r\nget the high-priced brandy from the shelf; and when he faced around again\r\nhe was looking into the muzzle of Slade\'s pistol.  "And the next\r\ninstant," added my informant, impressively, "he was one of the deadest\r\nmen that ever lived."\r\n\r\nThe stage-drivers and conductors told us that sometimes Slade would leave\r\na hated enemy wholly unmolested, unnoticed and unmentioned, for weeks\r\ntogether--had done it once or twice at any rate.  And some said they\r\nbelieved he did it in order to lull the victims into unwatchfulness, so\r\nthat he could get the advantage of them, and others said they believed he\r\nsaved up an enemy that way, just as a schoolboy saves up a cake, and made\r\nthe pleasure go as far as it would by gloating over the anticipation.\r\nOne of these cases was that of a Frenchman who had offended Slade.\r\nTo the surprise of everybody Slade did not kill him on the spot, but let\r\nhim alone for a considerable time.  Finally, however, he went to the\r\nFrenchman\'s house very late one night, knocked, and when his enemy opened\r\nthe door, shot him dead--pushed the corpse inside the door with his foot,\r\nset the house on fire and burned up the dead man, his widow and three\r\nchildren!  I heard this story from several different people, and they\r\nevidently believed what they were saying.  It may be true, and it may\r\nnot.  "Give a dog a bad name," etc.\r\n\r\nSlade was captured, once, by a party of men who intended to lynch him.\r\nThey disarmed him, and shut him up in a strong log-house, and placed a\r\nguard over him.  He prevailed on his captors to send for his wife, so\r\nthat he might have a last interview with her.  She was a brave, loving,\r\nspirited woman.  She jumped on a horse and rode for life and death.\r\nWhen she arrived they let her in without searching her, and before the\r\ndoor could be closed she whipped out a couple of revolvers, and she and\r\nher lord marched forth defying the party.  And then, under a brisk fire,\r\nthey mounted double and galloped away unharmed!\r\n\r\nIn the fulness of time Slade\'s myrmidons captured his ancient enemy\r\nJules, whom they found in a well-chosen hiding-place in the remote\r\nfastnesses of the mountains, gaining a precarious livelihood with his\r\nrifle.  They brought him to Rocky Ridge, bound hand and foot, and\r\ndeposited him in the middle of the cattle-yard with his back against a\r\npost.  It is said that the pleasure that lit Slade\'s face when he heard\r\nof it was something fearful to contemplate.  He examined his enemy to see\r\nthat he was securely tied, and then went to bed, content to wait till\r\nmorning before enjoying the luxury of killing him.  Jules spent the night\r\nin the cattle-yard, and it is a region where warm nights are never known.\r\nIn the morning Slade practised on him with his revolver, nipping the\r\nflesh here and there, and occasionally clipping off a finger, while Jules\r\nbegged him to kill him outright and put him out of his misery.  Finally\r\nSlade reloaded, and walking up close to his victim, made some\r\ncharacteristic remarks and then dispatched him.  The body lay there half\r\na day, nobody venturing to touch it without orders, and then Slade\r\ndetailed a party and assisted at the burial himself.  But he first cut\r\noff the dead man\'s ears and put them in his vest pocket, where he carried\r\nthem for some time with great satisfaction.  That is the story as I have\r\nfrequently heard it told and seen it in print in California newspapers.\r\nIt is doubtless correct in all essential particulars.\r\n\r\nIn due time we rattled up to a stage-station, and sat down to\r\nbreakfast with a half-savage, half-civilized company of armed and\r\nbearded mountaineers, ranchmen and station employees.  The most\r\ngentlemanly-appearing, quiet and affable officer we had yet found along\r\nthe road in the Overland Company\'s service was the person who sat at the\r\nhead of the table, at my elbow.  Never youth stared and shivered as I did\r\nwhen I heard them call him SLADE!\r\n\r\nHere was romance, and I sitting face to face with it!--looking upon it\r\n--touching it--hobnobbing with it, as it were!  Here, right by my side, was\r\nthe actual ogre who, in fights and brawls and various ways, had taken the\r\nlives of twenty-six human beings, or all men lied about him!  I suppose I\r\nwas the proudest stripling that ever traveled to see strange lands and\r\nwonderful people.\r\n\r\nHe was so friendly and so gentle-spoken that I warmed to him in\r\nspite of his awful history.  It was hardly possible to realize that\r\nthis pleasant person was the pitiless scourge of the outlaws, the\r\nraw-head-and-bloody-bones the nursing mothers of the mountains terrified\r\ntheir children with. And to this day I can remember nothing remarkable\r\nabout Slade except that his face was rather broad across the cheek bones,\r\nand that the cheek bones were low and the lips peculiarly thin and\r\nstraight.  But that was enough to leave something of an effect upon me,\r\nfor since then I seldom see a face possessing those characteristics\r\nwithout fancying that the owner of it is a dangerous man.\r\n\r\nThe coffee ran out.  At least it was reduced to one tin-cupful, and Slade\r\nwas about to take it when he saw that my cup was empty.\r\n\r\nHe politely offered to fill it, but although I wanted it, I politely\r\ndeclined.  I was afraid he had not killed anybody that morning, and might\r\nbe needing diversion.  But still with firm politeness he insisted on\r\nfilling my cup, and said I had traveled all night and better deserved it\r\nthan he--and while he talked he placidly poured the fluid, to the last\r\ndrop.  I thanked him and drank it, but it gave me no comfort, for I could\r\nnot feel sure that he would not be sorry, presently, that he had given it\r\naway, and proceed to kill me to distract his thoughts from the loss.\r\nBut nothing of the kind occurred.  We left him with only twenty-six dead\r\npeople to account for, and I felt a tranquil satisfaction in the thought\r\nthat in so judiciously taking care of No. 1 at that breakfast-table I had\r\npleasantly escaped being No. 27.  Slade came out to the coach and saw us\r\noff, first ordering certain rearrangements of the mail-bags for our\r\ncomfort, and then we took leave of him, satisfied that we should hear of\r\nhim again, some day, and wondering in what connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nAnd sure enough, two or three years afterward, we did hear him again.\r\nNews came to the Pacific coast that the Vigilance Committee in Montana\r\n(whither Slade had removed from Rocky Ridge) had hanged him.  I find an\r\naccount of the affair in the thrilling little book I quoted a paragraph\r\nfrom in the last chapter--"The Vigilantes of Montana; being a Reliable\r\nAccount of the Capture, Trial and Execution of Henry Plummer\'s Notorious\r\nRoad Agent Band: By Prof. Thos. J. Dimsdale, Virginia City, M.T."\r\nMr. Dimsdale\'s chapter is well worth reading, as a specimen of how the\r\npeople of the frontier deal with criminals when the courts of law prove\r\ninefficient.  Mr. Dimsdale makes two remarks about Slade, both of which\r\nare accurately descriptive, and one of which is exceedingly picturesque:\r\n"Those who saw him in his natural state only, would pronounce him to be a\r\nkind husband, a most hospitable host and a courteous gentleman; on the\r\ncontrary, those who met him when maddened with liquor and surrounded by a\r\ngang of armed roughs, would pronounce him a fiend incarnate."  And this:\r\n"From Fort Kearney, west, he was feared a great deal more than the\r\nalmighty."  For compactness, simplicity and vigor of expression, I will\r\n"back" that sentence against anything in literature.  Mr. Dimsdale\'s\r\nnarrative is as follows.  In all places where italics occur, they are\r\nmine:\r\n\r\n      After the execution of the five men on the 14th of January, the\r\n      Vigilantes considered that their work was nearly ended.  They had\r\n      freed the country of highwaymen and murderers to a great extent, and\r\n      they determined that in the absence of the regular civil authority\r\n      they would establish a People\'s Court where all offenders should be\r\n      tried by judge and jury.  This was the nearest approach to social\r\n      order that the circumstances permitted, and, though strict legal\r\n      authority was wanting, yet the people were firmly determined to\r\n      maintain its efficiency, and to enforce its decrees.  It may here be\r\n      mentioned that the overt act which was the last round on the fatal\r\n      ladder leading to the scaffold on which Slade perished, was the\r\n      tearing in pieces and stamping upon a writ of this court, followed\r\n      by his arrest of the Judge Alex. Davis, by authority of a presented\r\n      Derringer, and with his own hands.\r\n\r\n      J. A. Slade was himself, we have been informed, a Vigilante; he\r\n      openly boasted of it, and said he knew all that they knew.  He was\r\n      never accused, or even suspected, of either murder or robbery,\r\n      committed in this Territory (the latter crime was never laid to his\r\n      charge, in any place); but that he had killed several men in other\r\n      localities was notorious, and his bad reputation in this respect was\r\n      a most powerful argument in determining his fate, when he was\r\n      finally arrested for the offence above mentioned.  On returning from\r\n      Milk River he became more and more addicted to drinking, until at\r\n      last it was a common feat for him and his friends to "take the\r\n      town."  He and a couple of his dependents might often be seen on one\r\n      horse, galloping through the streets, shouting and yelling, firing\r\n      revolvers, etc.  On many occasions he would ride his horse into\r\n      stores, break up bars, toss the scales out of doors and use most\r\n      insulting language to parties present.  Just previous to the day of\r\n      his arrest, he had given a fearful beating to one of his followers;\r\n      but such was his influence over them that the man wept bitterly at\r\n      the gallows, and begged for his life with all his power.  It had\r\n      become quite common, when Slade was on a spree, for the shop-keepers\r\n      and citizens to close the stores and put out all the lights; being\r\n      fearful of some outrage at his hands.  For his wanton destruction of\r\n      goods and furniture, he was always ready to pay, when sober, if he\r\n      had money; but there were not a few who regarded payment as small\r\n      satisfaction for the outrage, and these men were his personal\r\n      enemies.\r\n\r\n      From time to time Slade received warnings from men that he well knew\r\n      would not deceive him, of the certain end of his conduct.  There was\r\n      not a moment, for weeks previous to his arrest, in which the public\r\n      did not expect to hear of some bloody outrage.  The dread of his\r\n      very name, and the presence of the armed band of hangers-on who\r\n      followed him alone prevented a resistance which must certainly have\r\n      ended in the instant murder or mutilation of the opposing party.\r\n\r\n      Slade was frequently arrested by order of the court whose\r\n      organization we have described, and had treated it with respect by\r\n      paying one or two fines and promising to pay the rest when he had\r\n      money; but in the transaction that occurred at this crisis, he\r\n      forgot even this caution, and goaded by passion and the hatred of\r\n      restraint, he sprang into the embrace of death.\r\n\r\n      Slade had been drunk and "cutting up" all night.  He and his\r\n      companions had made the town a perfect hell.  In the morning, J. M.\r\n      Fox, the sheriff, met him, arrested him, took him into court and\r\n      commenced reading a warrant that he had for his arrest, by way of\r\n      arraignment.  He became uncontrollably furious, and seizing the\r\n      writ, he tore it up, threw it on the ground and stamped upon it.\r\n\r\n      The clicking of the locks of his companions\' revolvers was instantly\r\n      heard, and a crisis was expected.  The sheriff did not attempt his\r\n      retention; but being at least as prudent as he was valiant, he\r\n      succumbed, leaving Slade the master of the situation and the\r\n      conqueror and ruler of the courts, law and law-makers.  This was a\r\n      declaration of war, and was so accepted.  The Vigilance Committee\r\n      now felt that the question of social order and the preponderance of\r\n      the law-abiding citizens had then and there to be decided.  They\r\n      knew the character of Slade, and they were well aware that they must\r\n      submit to his rule without murmur, or else that he must be dealt\r\n      with in such fashion as would prevent his being able to wreak his\r\n      vengeance on the committee, who could never have hoped to live in\r\n      the Territory secure from outrage or death, and who could never\r\n      leave it without encountering his friend, whom his victory would\r\n      have emboldened and stimulated to a pitch that would have rendered\r\n      them reckless of consequences.  The day previous he had ridden into\r\n      Dorris\'s store, and on being requested to leave, he drew his\r\n      revolver and threatened to kill the gentleman who spoke to him.\r\n      Another saloon he had led his horse into, and buying a bottle of\r\n      wine, he tried to make the animal drink it.  This was not considered\r\n      an uncommon performance, as he had often entered saloons and\r\n      commenced firing at the lamps, causing a wild stampede.\r\n\r\n      A leading member of the committee met Slade, and informed him in the\r\n      quiet, earnest manner of one who feels the importance of what he is\r\n      saying: "Slade, get your horse at once, and go home, or there will\r\n      be ---- to pay."  Slade started and took a long look, with his dark\r\n      and piercing eyes, at the gentleman.  "What do you mean?"  said he.\r\n      "You have no right to ask me what I mean," was the quiet reply, "get\r\n      your horse at once, and remember what I tell you."  After a short\r\n      pause he promised to do so, and actually got into the saddle; but,\r\n      being still intoxicated, he began calling aloud to one after another\r\n      of his friends, and at last seemed to have forgotten the warning he\r\n      had received and became again uproarious, shouting the name of a\r\n      well-known courtezan in company with those of two men whom he\r\n      considered heads of the committee, as a sort of challenge; perhaps,\r\n      however, as a simple act of bravado.  It seems probable that the\r\n      intimation of personal danger he had received had not been forgotten\r\n      entirely; though fatally for him, he took a foolish way of showing\r\n      his remembrance of it.  He sought out Alexander Davis, the Judge of\r\n      the Court, and drawing a cocked Derringer, he presented it at his\r\n      head, and told him that he should hold him as a hostage for his own\r\n      safety.  As the judge stood perfectly quiet, and offered no\r\n      resistance to his captor, no further outrage followed on this score.\r\n      Previous to this, on account of the critical state of affairs, the\r\n      committee had met, and at last resolved to arrest him.  His\r\n      execution had not been agreed upon, and, at that time, would have\r\n      been negatived, most assuredly.  A messenger rode down to Nevada to\r\n      inform the leading men of what was on hand, as it was desirable to\r\n      show that there was a feeling of unanimity on the subject, all along\r\n      the gulch.\r\n\r\n      The miners turned out almost en masse, leaving their work and\r\n      forming in solid column about six hundred strong, armed to the\r\n      teeth, they marched up to Virginia.  The leader of the body well\r\n      knew the temper of his men on the subject.  He spurred on ahead of\r\n      them, and hastily calling a meeting of the executive, he told them\r\n      plainly that the miners meant "business," and that, if they came up,\r\n      they would not stand in the street to be shot down by Slade\'s\r\n      friends; but that they would take him and hang him.  The meeting was\r\n      small, as the Virginia men were loath to act at all.  This momentous\r\n      announcement of the feeling of the Lower Town was made to a cluster\r\n      of men, who were deliberation behind a wagon, at the rear of a store\r\n      on Main street.\r\n\r\n      The committee were most unwilling to proceed to extremities.  All\r\n      the duty they had ever performed seemed as nothing to the task\r\n      before them; but they had to decide, and that quickly.  It was\r\n      finally agreed that if the whole body of the miners were of the\r\n      opinion that he should be hanged, that the committee left it in\r\n      their hands to deal with him.  Off, at hot speed, rode the leader of\r\n      the Nevada men to join his command.\r\n\r\n      Slade had found out what was intended, and the news sobered him\r\n      instantly.  He went into P. S. Pfouts\' store, where Davis was, and\r\n      apologized for his conduct, saying that he would take it all back.\r\n\r\n      The head of the column now wheeled into Wallace street and marched\r\n      up at quick time.  Halting in front of the store, the executive\r\n      officer of the committee stepped forward and arrested Slade, who was\r\n      at once informed of his doom, and inquiry was made as to whether he\r\n      had any business to settle.  Several parties spoke to him on the\r\n      subject; but to all such inquiries he turned a deaf ear, being\r\n      entirely absorbed in the terrifying reflections on his own awful\r\n      position.  He never ceased his entreaties for life, and to see his\r\n      dear wife.  The unfortunate lady referred to, between whom and Slade\r\n      there existed a warm affection, was at this time living at their\r\n      ranch on the Madison.  She was possessed of considerable personal\r\n      attractions; tall, well-formed, of graceful carriage, pleasing\r\n      manners, and was, withal, an accomplished horsewoman.\r\n\r\n      A messenger from Slade rode at full speed to inform her of her\r\n      husband\'s arrest.  In an instant she was in the saddle, and with all\r\n      the energy that love and despair could lend to an ardent temperament\r\n      and a strong physique, she urged her fleet charger over the twelve\r\n      miles of rough and rocky ground that intervened between her and the\r\n      object of her passionate devotion.\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile a party of volunteers had made the necessary preparations\r\n      for the execution, in the valley traversed by the branch.  Beneath\r\n      the site of Pfouts and Russell\'s stone building there was a corral,\r\n      the gate-posts of which were strong and high.  Across the top was\r\n      laid a beam, to which the rope was fastened, and a dry-goods box\r\n      served for the platform.  To this place Slade was marched,\r\n      surrounded by a guard, composing the best armed and most numerous\r\n      force that has ever appeared in Montana Territory.\r\n\r\n      The doomed man had so exhausted himself by tears, prayers and\r\n      lamentations, that he had scarcely strength left to stand under the\r\n      fatal beam.  He repeatedly exclaimed, "My God! my God! must I die?\r\n      Oh, my dear wife!"\r\n\r\n      On the return of the fatigue party, they encountered some friends of\r\n      Slade, staunch and reliable citizens and members of the committee,\r\n      but who were personally attached to the condemned.  On hearing of\r\n      his sentence, one of them, a stout-hearted man, pulled out his\r\n      handkerchief and walked away, weeping like a child.  Slade still\r\n      begged to see his wife, most piteously, and it seemed hard to deny\r\n      his request; but the bloody consequences that were sure to follow\r\n      the inevitable attempt at a rescue, that her presence and entreaties\r\n      would have certainly incited, forbade the granting of his request.\r\n      Several gentlemen were sent for to see him, in his last moments, one\r\n      of whom (Judge Davis) made a short address to the people; but in\r\n      such low tones as to be inaudible, save to a few in his immediate\r\n      vicinity.  One of his friends, after exhausting his powers of\r\n      entreaty, threw off his coat and declared that the prisoner could\r\n      not be hanged until he himself was killed.  A hundred guns were\r\n      instantly leveled at him; whereupon he turned and fled; but, being\r\n      brought back, he was compelled to resume his coat, and to give a\r\n      promise of future peaceable demeanor.\r\n\r\n      Scarcely a leading man in Virginia could be found, though numbers of\r\n      the citizens joined the ranks of the guard when the arrest was made.\r\n      All lamented the stern necessity which dictated the execution.\r\n\r\n      Everything being ready, the command was given, "Men, do your duty,"\r\n      and the box being instantly slipped from beneath his feet, he died\r\n      almost instantaneously.\r\n\r\n      The body was cut down and carried to the Virginia Hotel, where, in a\r\n      darkened room, it was scarcely laid out, when the unfortunate and\r\n      bereaved companion of the deceased arrived, at headlong speed, to\r\n      find that all was over, and that she was a widow.  Her grief and\r\n      heart-piercing cries were terrible evidences of the depth of her\r\n      attachment for her lost husband, and a considerable period elapsed\r\n      before she could regain the command of her excited feelings.\r\n\r\nThere is something about the desperado-nature that is wholly\r\nunaccountable--at least it looks unaccountable.  It is this.  The true\r\ndesperado is gifted with splendid courage, and yet he will take the most\r\ninfamous advantage of his enemy; armed and free, he will stand up before\r\na host and fight until he is shot all to pieces, and yet when he is under\r\nthe gallows and helpless he will cry and plead like a child.  Words are\r\ncheap, and it is easy to call Slade a coward (all executed men who do not\r\n"die game" are promptly called cowards by unreflecting people), and when\r\nwe read of Slade that he "had so exhausted himself by tears, prayers and\r\nlamentations, that he had scarcely strength left to stand under the fatal\r\nbeam," the disgraceful word suggests itself in a moment--yet in\r\nfrequently defying and inviting the vengeance of banded Rocky Mountain\r\ncut-throats by shooting down their comrades and leaders, and never\r\noffering to hide or fly, Slade showed that he was a man of peerless\r\nbravery.  No coward would dare that.  Many a notorious coward, many a\r\nchicken-livered poltroon, coarse, brutal, degraded, has made his dying\r\nspeech without a quaver in his voice and been swung into eternity with\r\nwhat looked liked the calmest fortitude, and so we are justified in\r\nbelieving, from the low intellect of such a creature, that it was not\r\nmoral courage that enabled him to do it.  Then, if moral courage is not\r\nthe requisite quality, what could it have been that this stout-hearted\r\nSlade lacked?--this bloody, desperate, kindly-mannered, urbane gentleman,\r\nwho never hesitated to warn his most ruffianly enemies that he would kill\r\nthem whenever or wherever he came across them next!  I think it is a\r\nconundrum worth investigating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nJust beyond the breakfast-station we overtook a Mormon emigrant train of\r\nthirty-three wagons; and tramping wearily along and driving their herd of\r\nloose cows, were dozens of coarse-clad and sad-looking men, women and\r\nchildren, who had walked as they were walking now, day after day for\r\neight lingering weeks, and in that time had compassed the distance our\r\nstage had come in eight days and three hours--seven hundred and\r\nninety-eight miles!  They were dusty and uncombed, hatless, bonnetless\r\nand ragged, and they did look so tired!\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, we bathed in Horse Creek, a (previously) limpid,\r\nsparkling stream--an appreciated luxury, for it was very seldom that our\r\nfurious coach halted long enough for an indulgence of that kind.  We\r\nchanged horses ten or twelve times in every twenty-four hours--changed\r\nmules, rather--six mules--and did it nearly every time in four minutes.\r\nIt was lively work.  As our coach rattled up to each station six\r\nharnessed mules stepped gayly from the stable; and in the twinkling of an\r\neye, almost, the old team was out, and the new one in and we off and away\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon we passed Sweetwater Creek, Independence Rock,\r\nDevil\'s Gate and the Devil\'s Gap.  The latter were wild specimens of\r\nrugged scenery, and full of interest--we were in the heart of the Rocky\r\nMountains, now.  And we also passed by "Alkali" or "Soda Lake," and we\r\nwoke up to the fact that our journey had stretched a long way across the\r\nworld when the driver said that the Mormons often came there from Great\r\nSalt Lake City to haul away saleratus.  He said that a few days gone by\r\nthey had shoveled up enough pure saleratus from the ground (it was a dry\r\nlake) to load two wagons, and that when they got these two wagons-loads\r\nof a drug that cost them nothing, to Salt Lake, they could sell it for\r\ntwenty-five cents a pound.\r\n\r\nIn the night we sailed by a most notable curiosity, and one we had been\r\nhearing a good deal about for a day or two, and were suffering to see.\r\nThis was what might be called a natural ice-house.  It was August, now,\r\nand sweltering weather in the daytime, yet at one of the stations the men\r\ncould scape the soil on the hill-side under the lee of a range of\r\nboulders, and at a depth of six inches cut out pure blocks of ice--hard,\r\ncompactly frozen, and clear as crystal!\r\n\r\nToward dawn we got under way again, and presently as we sat with raised\r\ncurtains enjoying our early-morning smoke and contemplating the first\r\nsplendor of the rising sun as it swept down the long array of mountain\r\npeaks, flushing and gilding crag after crag and summit after summit, as\r\nif the invisible Creator reviewed his gray veterans and they saluted with\r\na smile, we hove in sight of South Pass City.  The hotel-keeper, the\r\npostmaster, the blacksmith, the mayor, the constable, the city marshal\r\nand the principal citizen and property holder, all came out and greeted\r\nus cheerily, and we gave him good day.  He gave us a little Indian news,\r\nand a little Rocky Mountain news, and we gave him some Plains information\r\nin return.  He then retired to his lonely grandeur and we climbed on up\r\namong the bristling peaks and the ragged clouds.  South Pass City\r\nconsisted of four log cabins, one if which was unfinished, and the\r\ngentleman with all those offices and titles was the chiefest of the ten\r\ncitizens of the place.  Think of hotel-keeper, postmaster, blacksmith,\r\nmayor, constable, city marshal and principal citizen all condensed into\r\none person and crammed into one skin.  Bemis said he was "a perfect\r\nAllen\'s revolver of dignities."  And he said that if he were to die as\r\npostmaster, or as blacksmith, or as postmaster and blacksmith both, the\r\npeople might stand it; but if he were to die all over, it would be a\r\nfrightful loss to the community.\r\n\r\nTwo miles beyond South Pass City we saw for the first time that\r\nmysterious marvel which all Western untraveled boys have heard of and\r\nfully believe in, but are sure to be astounded at when they see it with\r\ntheir own eyes, nevertheless--banks of snow in dead summer time.  We were\r\nnow far up toward the sky, and knew all the time that we must presently\r\nencounter lofty summits clad in the "eternal snow" which was so common\r\nplace a matter of mention in books, and yet when I did see it glittering\r\nin the sun on stately domes in the distance and knew the month was August\r\nand that my coat was hanging up because it was too warm to wear it, I was\r\nfull as much amazed as if I never had heard of snow in August before.\r\nTruly, "seeing is believing"--and many a man lives a long life through,\r\nthinking he believes certain universally received and well established\r\nthings, and yet never suspects that if he were confronted by those things\r\nonce, he would discover that he did not really believe them before, but\r\nonly thought he believed them.\r\n\r\nIn a little while quite a number of peaks swung into view with long claws\r\nof glittering snow clasping them; and with here and there, in the shade,\r\ndown the mountain side, a little solitary patch of snow looking no larger\r\nthan a lady\'s pocket-handkerchief but being in reality as large as a\r\n"public square."\r\n\r\nAnd now, at last, we were fairly in the renowned SOUTH PASS, and whirling\r\ngayly along high above the common world.  We were perched upon the\r\nextreme summit of the great range of the Rocky Mountains, toward which we\r\nhad been climbing, patiently climbing, ceaselessly climbing, for days and\r\nnights together--and about us was gathered a convention of Nature\'s kings\r\nthat stood ten, twelve, and even thirteen thousand feet high--grand old\r\nfellows who would have to stoop to see Mount Washington, in the twilight.\r\nWe were in such an airy elevation above the creeping populations of the\r\nearth, that now and then when the obstructing crags stood out of the way\r\nit seemed that we could look around and abroad and contemplate the whole\r\ngreat globe, with its dissolving views of mountains, seas and continents\r\nstretching away through the mystery of the summer haze.\r\n\r\nAs a general thing the Pass was more suggestive of a valley than a\r\nsuspension bridge in the clouds--but it strongly suggested the latter at\r\none spot.  At that place the upper third of one or two majestic purple\r\ndomes projected above our level on either hand and gave us a sense of a\r\nhidden great deep of mountains and plains and valleys down about their\r\nbases which we fancied we might see if we could step to the edge and look\r\nover.  These Sultans of the fastnesses were turbaned with tumbled volumes\r\nof cloud, which shredded away from time to time and drifted off fringed\r\nand torn, trailing their continents of shadow after them; and catching\r\npresently on an intercepting peak, wrapped it about and brooded there\r\n--then shredded away again and left the purple peak, as they had left the\r\npurple domes, downy and white with new-laid snow.  In passing, these\r\nmonstrous rags of cloud hung low and swept along right over the\r\nspectator\'s head, swinging their tatters so nearly in his face that his\r\nimpulse was to shrink when they came closet.  In the one place I speak\r\nof, one could look below him upon a world of diminishing crags and\r\ncanyons leading down, down, and away to a vague plain with a thread in it\r\nwhich was a road, and bunches of feathers in it which were trees,--a\r\npretty picture sleeping in the sunlight--but with a darkness stealing\r\nover it and glooming its features  deeper and deeper under the frown of a\r\ncoming storm; and then, while no film or shadow marred the noon\r\nbrightness of his high perch, he could watch the tempest break forth down\r\nthere and see the lightnings leap from crag to crag and the sheeted rain\r\ndrive along the canyon-sides, and hear the thunders peal and crash and\r\nroar.  We had this spectacle; a familiar one to many, but to us a\r\nnovelty.\r\n\r\nWe bowled along cheerily, and presently, at the very summit (though it\r\nhad been all summit to us, and all equally level, for half an hour or\r\nmore), we came to a spring which spent its water through two outlets and\r\nsent it in opposite directions.  The conductor said that one of those\r\nstreams which we were looking at, was just starting on a journey westward\r\nto the Gulf of California and the Pacific Ocean, through hundreds and\r\neven thousands of miles of desert solitudes.  He said that the other was\r\njust leaving its home among the snow-peaks on a similar journey eastward\r\n--and we knew that long after we should have forgotten the simple rivulet\r\nit would still be plodding its patient way down the mountain sides, and\r\ncanyon-beds, and between the banks of the Yellowstone; and by and by\r\nwould join the broad Missouri and flow through unknown plains and deserts\r\nand unvisited wildernesses; and add a long and troubled pilgrimage among\r\nsnags and wrecks and sandbars; and enter the Mississippi, touch the\r\nwharves of St. Louis and still drift on, traversing shoals and rocky\r\nchannels, then endless chains of bottomless and ample bends, walled with\r\nunbroken forests, then mysterious byways and secret passages among woody\r\nislands, then the chained bends again, bordered with wide levels of\r\nshining sugar-cane in place of the sombre forests; then by New Orleans\r\nand still other chains of bends--and finally, after two long months of\r\ndaily and nightly harassment, excitement, enjoyment, adventure, and awful\r\nperil of parched throats, pumps and evaporation, pass the Gulf and enter\r\ninto its rest upon the bosom of the tropic sea, never to look upon its\r\nsnow-peaks again or regret them.\r\n\r\nI freighted a leaf with a mental message for the friends at home, and\r\ndropped it in the stream.  But I put no stamp on it and it was held for\r\npostage somewhere.\r\n\r\nOn the summit we overtook an emigrant train of many wagons, many tired\r\nmen and women, and many a disgusted sheep and cow.\r\n\r\nIn the wofully dusty horseman in charge of the expedition I recognized\r\nJohn -----.  Of all persons in the world to meet on top of the Rocky\r\nMountains thousands of miles from home, he was the last one I should have\r\nlooked for.  We were school-boys together and warm friends for years.\r\nBut a boyish prank of mine had disruptured this friendship and it had\r\nnever been renewed.  The act of which I speak was this.  I had been\r\naccustomed to visit occasionally an editor whose room was in the third\r\nstory of a building and overlooked the street.  One day this editor gave\r\nme a watermelon which I made preparations to devour on the spot, but\r\nchancing to look out of the window, I saw John standing directly under it\r\nand an irresistible desire came upon me to drop the melon on his head,\r\nwhich I immediately did.  I was the loser, for it spoiled the melon, and\r\nJohn never forgave me and we dropped all intercourse and parted, but now\r\nmet again under these circumstances.\r\n\r\nWe recognized each other simultaneously, and hands were grasped as warmly\r\nas if no coldness had ever existed between us, and no allusion was made\r\nto any.  All animosities were buried and the simple fact of meeting a\r\nfamiliar face in that isolated spot so far from home, was sufficient to\r\nmake us forget all things but pleasant ones, and we parted again with\r\nsincere "good-bye" and "God bless you" from both.\r\n\r\nWe had been climbing up the long shoulders of the Rocky Mountains for\r\nmany tedious hours--we started down them, now.  And we went spinning away\r\nat a round rate too.\r\n\r\nWe left the snowy Wind River Mountains and Uinta Mountains behind, and\r\nsped away, always through splendid scenery but occasionally through long\r\nranks of white skeletons of mules and oxen--monuments of the huge\r\nemigration of other days--and here and there were up-ended boards or\r\nsmall piles of stones which the driver said marked the resting-place of\r\nmore precious remains.\r\n\r\nIt was the loneliest land for a grave!  A land given over to the cayote\r\nand the raven--which is but another name for desolation and utter\r\nsolitude.  On damp, murky nights, these scattered skeletons gave forth a\r\nsoft, hideous glow, like very faint spots of moonlight starring the vague\r\ndesert.  It was because of the phosphorus in the bones.  But no\r\nscientific explanation could keep a body from shivering when he drifted\r\nby one of those ghostly lights and knew that a skull held it.\r\n\r\nAt midnight it began to rain, and I never saw anything like it--indeed, I\r\ndid not even see this, for it was too dark.  We fastened down the\r\ncurtains and even caulked them with clothing, but the rain streamed in in\r\ntwenty places, nothwithstanding.  There was no escape.  If one moved his\r\nfeet out of a stream, he brought his body under one; and if he moved his\r\nbody he caught one somewhere else.  If he struggled out of the drenched\r\nblankets and sat up, he was bound to get one down the back of his neck.\r\nMeantime the stage was wandering about a plain with gaping gullies in it,\r\nfor the driver could not see an inch before his face nor keep the road,\r\nand the storm pelted so pitilessly that there was no keeping the horses\r\nstill.  With the first abatement the conductor turned out with lanterns\r\nto look for the road, and the first dash he made was into a chasm about\r\nfourteen feet deep, his lantern following like a meteor.  As soon as he\r\ntouched bottom he sang out frantically:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t come here!"\r\n\r\nTo which the driver, who was looking over the precipice where he had\r\ndisappeared, replied, with an injured air: "Think I\'m a dam fool?"\r\n\r\nThe conductor was more than an hour finding the road--a matter which\r\nshowed us how far we had wandered and what chances we had been taking.\r\nHe traced our wheel-tracks to the imminent verge of danger, in two\r\nplaces.  I have always been glad that we were not killed that night.\r\nI do not know any particular reason, but I have always been glad.\r\nIn the morning, the tenth day out, we crossed Green River, a fine, large,\r\nlimpid stream--stuck in it with the water just up to the top of our\r\nmail-bed, and waited till extra teams were put on to haul us up the steep\r\nbank.  But it was nice cool water, and besides it could not find any\r\nfresh place on us to wet.\r\n\r\nAt the Green River station we had breakfast--hot biscuits, fresh antelope\r\nsteaks, and coffee--the only decent meal we tasted between the United\r\nStates and Great Salt Lake City, and the only one we were ever really\r\nthankful for.\r\n\r\nThink of the monotonous execrableness of the thirty that went before it,\r\nto leave this one simple breakfast looming up in my memory like a\r\nshot-tower after all these years have gone by!\r\n\r\nAt five P.M.  we reached Fort Bridger, one hundred and seventeen miles\r\nfrom the South Pass, and one thousand and twenty-five miles from St.\r\nJoseph.  Fifty-two miles further on, near the head of Echo Canyon, we met\r\nsixty United States soldiers from Camp Floyd.  The day before, they had\r\nfired upon three hundred or four hundred Indians, whom they supposed\r\ngathered together for no good purpose.  In the fight that had ensued,\r\nfour Indians were captured, and the main body chased four miles, but\r\nnobody killed.  This looked like business.  We had a notion to get out\r\nand join the sixty soldiers, but upon reflecting that there were four\r\nhundred of the Indians, we concluded to go on and join the Indians.\r\n\r\nEcho Canyon is twenty miles long.  It was like a long, smooth, narrow\r\nstreet, with a gradual descending grade, and shut in by enormous\r\nperpendicular walls of coarse conglomerate, four hundred feet high in\r\nmany places, and turreted like mediaeval castles.  This was the most\r\nfaultless piece of road in the mountains, and the driver said he would\r\n"let his team out."  He did, and if the Pacific express trains whiz\r\nthrough there now any faster than we did then in the stage-coach, I envy\r\nthe passengers the exhilaration of it.  We fairly seemed to pick up our\r\nwheels and fly--and the mail matter was lifted up free from everything\r\nand held in solution!  I am not given to exaggeration, and when I say a\r\nthing I mean it.\r\n\r\nHowever, time presses.  At four in the afternoon we arrived on the summit\r\nof Big Mountain, fifteen miles from Salt Lake City, when all the world\r\nwas glorified with the setting sun, and the most stupendous panorama of\r\nmountain peaks yet encountered burst on our sight.  We looked out upon\r\nthis sublime spectacle from under the arch of a brilliant rainbow!  Even\r\nthe overland stage-driver stopped his horses and gazed!\r\n\r\nHalf an hour or an hour later, we changed horses, and took supper with a\r\nMormon "Destroying Angel."\r\n\r\n"Destroying Angels," as I understand it, are Latter-Day Saints who are\r\nset apart by the Church to conduct permanent disappearances of obnoxious\r\ncitizens.  I had heard a deal about these Mormon Destroying Angels and\r\nthe dark and bloody deeds they had done, and when I entered this one\'s\r\nhouse I had my shudder all ready.  But alas for all our romances, he was\r\nnothing but a loud, profane, offensive, old blackguard!  He was murderous\r\nenough, possibly, to fill the bill of a Destroyer, but would you have any\r\nkind of an Angel devoid of dignity?  Could you abide an Angel in an\r\nunclean shirt and no suspenders?  Could you respect an Angel with a\r\nhorse-laugh and a swagger like a buccaneer?\r\n\r\nThere were other blackguards present--comrades of this one.  And there\r\nwas one person that looked like a gentleman--Heber C. Kimball\'s son, tall\r\nand well made, and thirty years old, perhaps.  A lot of slatternly women\r\nflitted hither and thither in a hurry, with coffee-pots, plates of bread,\r\nand other appurtenances to supper, and these were said to be the wives of\r\nthe Angel--or some of them, at least.  And of course they were; for if\r\nthey had been hired "help" they would not have let an angel from above\r\nstorm and swear at them as he did, let alone one from the place this one\r\nhailed from.\r\n\r\nThis was our first experience of the western "peculiar institution," and\r\nit was not very prepossessing.  We did not tarry long to observe it, but\r\nhurried on to the home of the Latter-Day Saints, the stronghold of the\r\nprophets, the capital of the only absolute monarch in America--Great Salt\r\nLake City.  As the night closed in we took sanctuary in the Salt Lake\r\nHouse and unpacked our baggage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nWe had a fine supper, of the freshest meats and fowls and vegetables--a\r\ngreat variety and as great abundance.  We walked about the streets some,\r\nafterward, and glanced in at shops and stores; and there was fascination\r\nin surreptitiously staring at every creature we took to be a Mormon.\r\nThis was fairy-land to us, to all intents and purposes--a land of\r\nenchantment, and goblins, and awful mystery.  We felt a curiosity to ask\r\nevery child how many mothers it had, and if it could tell them apart; and\r\nwe experienced a thrill every time a dwelling-house door opened and shut\r\nas we passed, disclosing a glimpse of human heads and backs and\r\nshoulders--for we so longed to have a good satisfying look at a Mormon\r\nfamily in all its comprehensive ampleness, disposed in the customary\r\nconcentric rings of its home circle.\r\n\r\nBy and by the Acting Governor of the Territory introduced us to other\r\n"Gentiles," and we spent a sociable hour with them.  "Gentiles" are\r\npeople who are not Mormons.  Our fellow-passenger, Bemis, took care of\r\nhimself, during this part of the evening, and did not make an\r\noverpowering success of it, either, for he came into our room in the\r\nhotel about eleven o\'clock, full of cheerfulness, and talking loosely,\r\ndisjointedly and indiscriminately, and every now and then tugging out a\r\nragged word by the roots that had more hiccups than syllables in it.\r\nThis, together with his hanging his coat on the floor on one side of a\r\nchair, and his vest on the floor on the other side, and piling his pants\r\non the floor just in front of the same chair, and then comtemplating the\r\ngeneral result with superstitious awe, and finally pronouncing it "too\r\nmany for him" and going to bed with his boots on, led us to fear that\r\nsomething he had eaten had not agreed with him.\r\n\r\nBut we knew afterward that it was something he had been drinking.  It was\r\nthe exclusively Mormon refresher, "valley tan."\r\n\r\nValley tan (or, at least, one form of valley tan) is a kind of whisky,\r\nor first cousin to it; is of Mormon invention and manufactured only in\r\nUtah.  Tradition says it is made of (imported) fire and brimstone.  If I\r\nremember rightly no public drinking saloons were allowed in the kingdom\r\nby Brigham Young, and no private drinking permitted among the faithful,\r\nexcept they confined themselves to "valley tan."\r\n\r\nNext day we strolled about everywhere through the broad, straight, level\r\nstreets, and enjoyed the pleasant strangeness of a city of fifteen\r\nthousand inhabitants with no loafers perceptible in it; and no visible\r\ndrunkards or noisy people; a limpid stream rippling and dancing through\r\nevery street in place of a filthy gutter; block after block of trim\r\ndwellings, built of "frame" and sunburned brick--a great thriving orchard\r\nand garden behind every one of them, apparently--branches from the street\r\nstream winding and sparkling among the garden beds and fruit trees--and a\r\ngrand general air of neatness, repair, thrift and comfort, around and\r\nabout and over the whole.  And everywhere were workshops, factories, and\r\nall manner of industries; and intent faces and busy hands were to be seen\r\nwherever one looked; and in one\'s ears was the ceaseless clink of\r\nhammers, the buzz of trade and the contented hum of drums and fly-wheels.\r\n\r\nThe armorial crest of my own State consisted of two dissolute bears\r\nholding up the head of a dead and gone cask between them and making the\r\npertinent remark, "UNITED, WE STAND--(hic!)--DIVIDED, WE FALL."  It was\r\nalways too figurative for the author of this book.  But the Mormon crest\r\nwas easy.  And it was simple, unostentatious, and fitted like a glove.\r\nIt was a representation of a GOLDEN BEEHIVE, with the bees all at work!\r\n\r\nThe city lies in the edge of a level plain as broad as the State of\r\nConnecticut, and crouches close down to the ground under a curving wall\r\nof mighty mountains whose heads are hidden in the clouds, and whose\r\nshoulders bear relics of the snows of winter all the summer long.\r\n\r\nSeen from one of these dizzy heights, twelve or fifteen miles off, Great\r\nSalt Lake City is toned down and diminished till it is suggestive of a\r\nchild\'s toy-village reposing under the majestic protection of the Chinese\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nOn some of those mountains, to the southwest, it had been raining every\r\nday for two weeks, but not a drop had fallen in the city.  And on hot\r\ndays in late spring and early autumn the citizens could quit fanning and\r\ngrowling and go out and cool off by looking at the luxury of a glorious\r\nsnow-storm going on in the mountains.  They could enjoy it at a distance,\r\nat those seasons, every day, though no snow would fall in their streets,\r\nor anywhere near them.\r\n\r\nSalt Lake City was healthy--an extremely healthy city.\r\n\r\nThey declared there was only one physician in the place and he was\r\narrested every week regularly and held to answer under the vagrant act\r\nfor having "no visible means of support."  They always give you a good\r\nsubstantial article of truth in Salt Lake, and good measure and good\r\nweight, too. [Very often, if you wished to weigh one of their airiest\r\nlittle commonplace statements you would want the hay scales.]\r\n\r\nWe desired to visit the famous inland sea, the American "Dead Sea," the\r\ngreat Salt Lake--seventeen miles, horseback, from the city--for we had\r\ndreamed about it, and thought about it, and talked about it, and yearned\r\nto see it, all the first part of our trip; but now when it was only arm\'s\r\nlength away it had suddenly lost nearly every bit of its interest.  And\r\nso we put it off, in a sort of general way, till next day--and that was\r\nthe last we ever thought of it.  We dined with some hospitable Gentiles;\r\nand visited the foundation of the prodigious temple; and talked long with\r\nthat shrewd Connecticut Yankee, Heber C. Kimball (since deceased), a\r\nsaint of high degree and a mighty man of commerce.\r\n\r\nWe saw the "Tithing-House," and the "Lion House," and I do not know or\r\nremember how many more church and government buildings of various kinds\r\nand curious names.  We flitted hither and thither and enjoyed every hour,\r\nand picked up a great deal of useful information and entertaining\r\nnonsense, and went to bed at night satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe second day, we made the acquaintance of Mr. Street (since deceased)\r\nand put on white shirts and went and paid a state visit to the king.\r\nHe seemed a quiet, kindly, easy-mannered, dignified, self-possessed old\r\ngentleman of fifty-five or sixty, and had a gentle craft in his eye that\r\nprobably belonged there.  He was very simply dressed and was just taking\r\noff a straw hat as we entered.  He talked about Utah, and the Indians,\r\nand Nevada, and general American matters and questions, with our\r\nsecretary and certain government officials who came with us.  But he\r\nnever paid any attention to me, notwithstanding I made several attempts\r\nto "draw him out" on federal politics and his high handed attitude toward\r\nCongress.  I thought some of the things I said were rather fine.  But he\r\nmerely looked around at me, at distant intervals, something as I have\r\nseen a benignant old cat look around to see which kitten was meddling\r\nwith her tail.\r\n\r\nBy and by I subsided into an indignant silence, and so sat until the end,\r\nhot and flushed, and execrating him in my heart for an ignorant savage.\r\nBut he was calm.  His conversation with those gentlemen flowed on as\r\nsweetly and peacefully and musically as any summer brook.  When the\r\naudience was ended and we were retiring from the presence, he put his\r\nhand on my head, beamed down on me in an admiring way and said to my\r\nbrother:\r\n\r\n"Ah--your child, I presume?  Boy, or girl?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nMr. Street was very busy with his telegraphic matters--and considering\r\nthat he had eight or nine hundred miles of rugged, snowy, uninhabited\r\nmountains, and waterless, treeless, melancholy deserts to traverse with\r\nhis wire, it was natural and needful that he should be as busy as\r\npossible.  He could not go comfortably along and cut his poles by the\r\nroad-side, either, but they had to be hauled by ox teams across those\r\nexhausting deserts--and it was two days\' journey from water to water, in\r\none or two of them.  Mr. Street\'s contract was a vast work, every way one\r\nlooked at it; and yet to comprehend what the vague words "eight hundred\r\nmiles of rugged mountains and dismal deserts" mean, one must go over the\r\nground in person--pen and ink descriptions cannot convey the dreary\r\nreality to the reader.  And after all, Mr. S.\'s mightiest difficulty\r\nturned out to be one which he had never taken into the account at all.\r\nUnto Mormons he had sub-let the hardest and heaviest half of his great\r\nundertaking, and all of a sudden they concluded that they were going to\r\nmake little or nothing, and so they tranquilly threw their poles\r\noverboard in mountain or desert, just as it happened when they took the\r\nnotion, and drove home and went about their customary business!  They\r\nwere under written contract to Mr. Street, but they did not care anything\r\nfor that.  They said they would "admire" to see a "Gentile" force a\r\nMormon to fulfil a losing contract in Utah!  And they made themselves\r\nvery merry over the matter.  Street said--for it was he that told us\r\nthese things:\r\n\r\n"I was in dismay.  I was under heavy bonds to complete my contract in a\r\ngiven time, and this disaster looked very much like ruin.  It was an\r\nastounding thing; it was such a wholly unlooked-for difficulty, that I\r\nwas entirely nonplussed.  I am a business man--have always been a\r\nbusiness man--do not know anything but business--and so you can imagine\r\nhow like being struck by lightning it was to find myself in a country\r\nwhere written contracts were worthless!--that main security, that\r\nsheet-anchor, that absolute necessity, of business.  My confidence left\r\nme. There was no use in making new contracts--that was plain.  I talked\r\nwith first one prominent citizen and then another.  They all sympathized\r\nwith me, first rate, but they did not know how to help me.  But at last a\r\nGentile said, \'Go to Brigham Young!--these small fry cannot do you any\r\ngood.\'  I did not think much of the idea, for if the law could not help\r\nme, what could an individual do who had not even anything to do with\r\neither making the laws or executing them?  He might be a very good\r\npatriarch of a church and preacher in its tabernacle, but something\r\nsterner than religion and moral suasion was needed to handle a hundred\r\nrefractory, half-civilized sub-contractors.  But what was a man to do? I\r\nthought if Mr. Young could not do anything else, he might probably be\r\nable to give me some advice and a valuable hint or two, and so I went\r\nstraight to him and laid the whole case before him.  He said very little,\r\nbut he showed strong interest all the way through.  He examined all the\r\npapers in detail, and whenever there seemed anything like a hitch, either\r\nin the papers or my statement, he would go back and take up the thread\r\nand follow it patiently out to an intelligent and satisfactory result.\r\nThen he made a list of the contractors\' names.  Finally he said:\r\n\r\n"\'Mr. Street, this is all perfectly plain.  These contracts are strictly\r\nand legally drawn, and are duly signed and certified.  These men\r\nmanifestly entered into them with their eyes open.  I see no fault or\r\nflaw anywhere.\'\r\n\r\n"Then Mr. Young turned to a man waiting at the other end of the room and\r\nsaid: \'Take this list of names to So-and-so, and tell him to have these\r\nmen here at such-and-such an hour.\'\r\n\r\n"They were there, to the minute.  So was I.  Mr. Young asked them a\r\nnumber of questions, and their answers made my statement good.  Then he\r\nsaid to them:\r\n\r\n"\'You signed these contracts and assumed these obligations of your own\r\nfree will and accord?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Yes.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Then carry them out to the letter, if it makes paupers of you!  Go!\'\r\n\r\n"And they did go, too!  They are strung across the deserts now, working\r\nlike bees.  And I never hear a word out of them.\r\n\r\n"There is a batch of governors, and judges, and other officials here,\r\nshipped from Washington, and they maintain the semblance of a republican\r\nform of government--but the petrified truth is that Utah is an absolute\r\nmonarchy and Brigham Young is king!"\r\n\r\nMr. Street was a fine man, and I believe his story.  I knew him well\r\nduring several years afterward in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nOur stay in Salt Lake City amounted to only two days, and therefore we\r\nhad no time to make the customary inquisition into the workings of\r\npolygamy and get up the usual statistics and deductions preparatory to\r\ncalling the attention of the nation at large once more to the matter.\r\n\r\nI had the will to do it.  With the gushing self-sufficiency of youth I\r\nwas feverish to plunge in headlong and achieve a great reform here--until\r\nI saw the Mormon women.  Then I was touched.  My heart was wiser than my\r\nhead.  It warmed toward these poor, ungainly and pathetically "homely"\r\ncreatures, and as I turned to hide the generous moisture in my eyes, I\r\nsaid, "No--the man that marries one of them has done an act of Christian\r\ncharity which entitles him to the kindly applause of mankind, not their\r\nharsh censure--and the man that marries sixty of them has done a deed of\r\nopen-handed generosity so sublime that the nations should stand uncovered\r\nin his presence and worship in silence."\r\n\r\n      [For a brief sketch of Mormon history, and the noted Mountain Meadow\r\n      massacre, see Appendices A and B. ]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nIt is a luscious country for thrilling evening stories about\r\nassassinations of intractable Gentiles.  I cannot easily conceive of\r\nanything more cosy than the night in Salt Lake which we spent in a\r\nGentile den, smoking pipes and listening to tales of how Burton galloped\r\nin among the pleading and defenceless "Morisites" and shot them down, men\r\nand women, like so many dogs.  And how Bill Hickman, a Destroying Angel,\r\nshot Drown and Arnold dead for bringing suit against him for a debt.\r\nAnd how Porter Rockwell did this and that dreadful thing.  And how\r\nheedless people often come to Utah and make remarks about Brigham, or\r\npolygamy, or some other sacred matter, and the very next morning at\r\ndaylight such parties are sure to be found lying up some back alley,\r\ncontentedly waiting for the hearse.\r\n\r\nAnd the next most interesting thing is to sit and listen to these\r\nGentiles talk about polygamy; and how some portly old frog of an elder,\r\nor a bishop, marries a girl--likes her, marries her sister--likes her,\r\nmarries another sister--likes her, takes another--likes her, marries her\r\nmother--likes her, marries her father, grandfather, great grandfather,\r\nand then comes back hungry and asks for more.  And how the pert young\r\nthing of eleven will chance to be the favorite wife and her own venerable\r\ngrandmother have to rank away down toward D 4 in their mutual husband\'s\r\nesteem, and have to sleep in the kitchen, as like as not.  And how this\r\ndreadful sort of thing, this hiving together in one foul nest of mother\r\nand daughters, and the making a young daughter superior to her own mother\r\nin rank and authority, are things which Mormon women submit to because\r\ntheir religion teaches them that the more wives a man has on earth, and\r\nthe more children he rears, the higher the place they will all have in\r\nthe world to come--and the warmer, maybe, though they do not seem to say\r\nanything about that.\r\n\r\nAccording to these Gentile friends of ours, Brigham Young\'s harem\r\ncontains twenty or thirty wives.  They said that some of them had grown\r\nold and gone out of active service, but were comfortably housed and cared\r\nfor in the henery--or the Lion House, as it is strangely named.  Along\r\nwith each wife were her children--fifty altogether.  The house was\r\nperfectly quiet and orderly, when the children were still.  They all took\r\ntheir meals in one room, and a happy and home-like sight it was\r\npronounced to be.  None of our party got an opportunity to take dinner\r\nwith Mr. Young, but a Gentile by the name of Johnson professed to have\r\nenjoyed a sociable breakfast in the Lion House.  He gave a preposterous\r\naccount of the "calling of the roll," and other preliminaries, and the\r\ncarnage that ensued when the buckwheat cakes came in.  But he embellished\r\nrather too much.  He said that Mr. Young told him several smart sayings\r\nof certain of his "two-year-olds," observing with some pride that for\r\nmany years he had been the heaviest contributor in that line to one of\r\nthe Eastern magazines; and then he wanted to show Mr. Johnson one of the\r\npets that had said the last good thing, but he could not find the child.\r\n\r\nHe searched the faces of the children in detail, but could not decide\r\nwhich one it was.  Finally he gave it up with a sigh and said:\r\n\r\n"I thought I would know the little cub again but I don\'t."  Mr. Johnson\r\nsaid further, that Mr. Young observed that life was a sad, sad thing\r\n--"because the joy of every new marriage a man contracted was so apt to be\r\nblighted by the inopportune funeral of a less recent bride."  And Mr.\r\nJohnson said that while he and Mr. Young were pleasantly conversing in\r\nprivate, one of the Mrs. Youngs came in and demanded a breast-pin,\r\nremarking that she had found out that he had been giving a breast-pin to\r\nNo. 6, and she, for one, did not propose to let this partiality go on\r\nwithout making a satisfactory amount of trouble about it.  Mr. Young\r\nreminded her that there was a stranger present.  Mrs. Young said that if\r\nthe state of things inside the house was not agreeable to the stranger,\r\nhe could find room outside.  Mr. Young promised the breast-pin, and she\r\nwent away.  But in a minute or two another Mrs. Young came in and\r\ndemanded a breast-pin.  Mr. Young began a remonstrance, but Mrs. Young\r\ncut him short.  She said No. 6 had got one, and No. 11 was promised one,\r\nand it was "no use for him to try to impose on her--she hoped she knew\r\nher rights."  He gave his promise, and she went.  And presently three\r\nMrs. Youngs entered in a body and opened on their husband a tempest of\r\ntears, abuse, and entreaty.  They had heard all about No. 6, No. 11, and\r\nNo. 14.  Three more breast-pins were promised.  They were hardly gone\r\nwhen nine more Mrs. Youngs filed into the presence, and a new tempest\r\nburst forth and raged round about the prophet and his guest.  Nine\r\nbreast-pins were promised, and the weird sisters filed out again.  And in\r\ncame eleven more, weeping and wailing and gnashing their teeth.  Eleven\r\npromised breast-pins purchased peace once more.\r\n\r\n"That is a specimen," said Mr. Young.  "You see how it is.  You see what\r\na life I lead.  A man can\'t be wise all the time.  In a heedless moment I\r\ngave my darling No. 6--excuse my calling her thus, as her other name has\r\nescaped me for the moment--a breast-pin.  It was only worth twenty-five\r\ndollars--that is, apparently that was its whole cost--but its ultimate\r\ncost was inevitably bound to be a good deal more.  You yourself have seen\r\nit climb up to six hundred and fifty dollars--and alas, even that is not\r\nthe end!  For I have wives all over this Territory of Utah.  I have\r\ndozens of wives whose numbers, even, I do not know without looking in the\r\nfamily Bible.  They are scattered far and wide among the mountains and\r\nvalleys of my realm.  And mark you, every solitary one of them will hear\r\nof this wretched breast pin, and every last one of them will have one or\r\ndie.  No. 6\'s breast pin will cost me twenty-five hundred dollars before\r\nI see the end of it.  And these creatures will compare these pins\r\ntogether, and if one is a shade finer than the rest, they will all be\r\nthrown on my hands, and I will have to order a new lot to keep peace in\r\nthe family.  Sir, you probably did not know it, but all the time you were\r\npresent with my children your every movement was watched by vigilant\r\nservitors of mine.  If you had offered to give a child a dime, or a stick\r\nof candy, or any trifle of the kind, you would have been snatched out of\r\nthe house instantly, provided it could be done before your gift left your\r\nhand.  Otherwise it would be absolutely necessary for you to make an\r\nexactly similar gift to all my children--and knowing by experience the\r\nimportance of the thing, I would have stood by and seen to it myself that\r\nyou did it, and did it thoroughly.  Once a gentleman gave one of my\r\nchildren a tin whistle--a veritable invention of Satan, sir, and one\r\nwhich I have an unspeakable horror of, and so would you if you had eighty\r\nor ninety children in your house.  But the deed was done--the man\r\nescaped.  I knew what the result was going to be, and I thirsted for\r\nvengeance.  I ordered out a flock of Destroying Angels, and they hunted\r\nthe man far into the fastnesses of the Nevada mountains.  But they never\r\ncaught him.  I am not cruel, sir--I am not vindictive except when sorely\r\noutraged--but if I had caught him, sir, so help me Joseph Smith, I would\r\nhave locked him into the nursery till the brats whistled him to death.\r\nBy the slaughtered body of St. Parley Pratt (whom God assail!) there\r\nwas never anything on this earth like it!  I knew who gave the whistle to\r\nthe child, but I could, not make those jealous mothers believe me.  They\r\nbelieved I did it, and the result was just what any man of reflection\r\ncould have foreseen: I had to order a hundred and ten whistles--I think\r\nwe had a hundred and ten children in the house then, but some of them are\r\noff at college now--I had to order a hundred and ten of those shrieking\r\nthings, and I wish I may never speak another word if we didn\'t have to\r\ntalk on our fingers entirely, from that time forth until the children got\r\ntired of the whistles.  And if ever another man gives a whistle to a\r\nchild of mine and I get my hands on him, I will hang him higher than\r\nHaman!  That is the word with the bark on it!  Shade of Nephi!  You don\'t\r\nknow anything about married life.  I am rich, and everybody knows it.  I\r\nam benevolent, and everybody takes advantage of it.  I have a strong\r\nfatherly instinct and all the foundlings are foisted on me.\r\n\r\n"Every time a woman wants to do well by her darling, she puzzles her brain\r\nto cipher out some scheme for getting it into my hands.  Why, sir, a\r\nwoman came here once with a child of a curious lifeless sort of\r\ncomplexion (and so had the woman), and swore that the child was mine and\r\nshe my wife--that I had married her at such-and-such a time in\r\nsuch-and-such a place, but she had forgotten her number, and of course I\r\ncould not remember her name.  Well, sir, she called my attention to the\r\nfact that the child looked like me, and really it did seem to resemble\r\nme--a common thing in the Territory--and, to cut the story short, I put\r\nit in my nursery, and she left.  And by the ghost of Orson Hyde, when\r\nthey came to wash the paint off that child it was an Injun!  Bless my\r\nsoul, you don\'t know anything about married life.  It is a perfect dog\'s\r\nlife, sir--a perfect dog\'s life.  You can\'t economize.  It isn\'t\r\npossible.  I have tried keeping one set of bridal attire for all\r\noccasions.  But it is of no use.  First you\'ll marry a combination of\r\ncalico and consumption that\'s as thin as a rail, and next you\'ll get a\r\ncreature that\'s nothing more than the dropsy in disguise, and then you\'ve\r\ngot to eke out that bridal dress with an old balloon.  That is the way it\r\ngoes.  And think of the wash-bill--(excuse these tears)--nine hundred and\r\neighty-four pieces a week!  No, sir, there is no such a thing as economy\r\nin a family like mine.  Why, just the one item of cradles--think of it!\r\nAnd vermifuge! Soothing syrup!  Teething rings!  And \'papa\'s watches\' for\r\nthe babies to play with!  And things to scratch the furniture with!  And\r\nlucifer matches for them to eat, and pieces of glass to cut themselves\r\nwith! The item of glass alone would support your family, I venture to\r\nsay, sir. Let me scrimp and squeeze all I can, I still can\'t get ahead as\r\nfast as I feel I ought to, with my opportunities.  Bless you, sir, at a\r\ntime when I had seventy-two wives in this house, I groaned under the\r\npressure of keeping thousands of dollars tied up in seventy-two bedsteads\r\nwhen the money ought to have been out at interest; and I just sold out\r\nthe whole stock, sir, at a sacrifice, and built a bedstead seven feet\r\nlong and ninety-six feet wide.  But it was a failure, sir.  I could not\r\nsleep. It appeared to me that the whole seventy-two women snored at once.\r\nThe roar was deafening.  And then the danger of it!  That was what I was\r\nlooking at.  They would all draw in their breath at once, and you could\r\nactually see the walls of the house suck in--and then they would all\r\nexhale their breath at once, and you could see the walls swell out, and\r\nstrain, and hear the rafters crack, and the shingles grind together. My\r\nfriend, take an old man\'s advice, and don\'t encumber yourself with a\r\nlarge family--mind, I tell you, don\'t do it.  In a small family, and in a\r\nsmall family only, you will find that comfort and that peace of mind\r\nwhich are the best at last of the blessings this world is able to afford\r\nus, and for the lack of which no accumulation of wealth, and no\r\nacquisition of fame, power, and greatness can ever compensate us. Take my\r\nword for it, ten or eleven wives is all you need--never go over it."\r\n\r\nSome instinct or other made me set this Johnson down as being unreliable.\r\nAnd yet he was a very entertaining person, and I doubt if some of the\r\ninformation he gave us could have been acquired from any other source.\r\nHe was a pleasant contrast to those reticent Mormons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nAll men have heard of the Mormon Bible, but few except the "elect" have\r\nseen it, or, at least, taken the trouble to read it.  I brought away a\r\ncopy from Salt Lake.  The book is a curiosity to me, it is such a\r\npretentious affair, and yet so "slow," so sleepy; such an insipid mess of\r\ninspiration.  It is chloroform in print.  If Joseph Smith composed this\r\nbook, the act was a miracle--keeping awake while he did it was, at any\r\nrate.  If he, according to tradition, merely translated it from certain\r\nancient and mysteriously-engraved plates of copper, which he declares he\r\nfound under a stone, in an out-of-the-way locality, the work of\r\ntranslating was equally a miracle, for the same reason.\r\n\r\nThe book seems to be merely a prosy detail of imaginary history, with the\r\nOld Testament for a model; followed by a tedious plagiarism of the New\r\nTestament.  The author labored to give his words and phrases the quaint,\r\nold-fashioned sound and structure of our King James\'s translation of the\r\nScriptures; and the result is a mongrel--half modern glibness, and half\r\nancient simplicity and gravity.  The latter is awkward and constrained;\r\nthe former natural, but grotesque by the contrast.  Whenever he found his\r\nspeech growing too modern--which was about every sentence or two--he\r\nladled in a few such Scriptural phrases as "exceeding sore," "and it came\r\nto pass," etc., and made things satisfactory again.  "And it came to\r\npass" was his pet.  If he had left that out, his Bible would have been\r\nonly a pamphlet.\r\n\r\nThe title-page reads as follows:\r\n\r\n      THE BOOK OF MORMON: AN ACCOUNT WRITTEN BY THE HAND OF MORMON, UPON\r\n      PLATES TAKEN FROM THE PLATES OF NEPHI.\r\n\r\n      Wherefore it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi,\r\n      and also of the Lamanites; written to the Lamanites, who are a\r\n      remnant of the House of Israel; and also to Jew and Gentile; written\r\n      by way of commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of\r\n      revelation.  Written and sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord, that\r\n      they might not be destroyed; to come forth by the gift and power of\r\n      God unto the interpretation thereof; sealed by the hand of Moroni,\r\n      and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in due time by the way of\r\n      Gentile; the interpretation thereof by the gift of God.  An\r\n      abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also; which is a record of\r\n      the people of Jared; who were scattered at the time the Lord\r\n      confounded the language of the people when they were building a\r\n      tower to get to Heaven.\r\n\r\n"Hid up" is good.  And so is "wherefore"--though why "wherefore"?  Any\r\nother word would have answered as well--though--in truth it would not\r\nhave sounded so Scriptural.\r\n\r\nNext comes:\r\n\r\n      THE TESTIMONY OF THREE WITNESSES.\r\n      Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people unto\r\n      whom this work shall come, that we, through the grace of God the\r\n      Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates which\r\n      contain this record, which is a record of the people of Nephi, and\r\n      also of the Lamanites, their brethren, and also of the people of\r\n      Jared, who came from the tower of which hath been spoken; and we\r\n      also know that they have been translated by the gift and power of\r\n      God, for His voice hath declared it unto us; wherefore we know of a\r\n      surety that the work is true.  And we also testify that we have seen\r\n      the engravings which are upon the plates; and they have been shown\r\n      unto us by the power of God, and not of man.  And we declare with\r\n      words of soberness, that an angel of God came down from heaven, and\r\n      he brought and laid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the\r\n      plates, and the engravings thereon; and we know that it is by the\r\n      grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that we beheld\r\n      and bear record that these things are true; and it is marvellous in\r\n      our eyes; nevertheless the voice of the Lord commanded us that we\r\n      should bear record of it; wherefore, to be obedient unto the\r\n      commandments of God, we bear testimony of these things.  And we know\r\n      that if we are faithful in Christ, we shall rid our garments of the\r\n      blood of all men, and be found spotless before the judgment-seat of\r\n      Christ, and shall dwell with Him eternally in the heavens.  And the\r\n      honor be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, which\r\n      is one God.  Amen.\r\n                          OLIVER COWDERY,\r\n                          DAVID WHITMER,\r\n                          MARTIN HARRIS.\r\n\r\nSome people have to have a world of evidence before they can come\r\nanywhere in the neighborhood of believing anything; but for me, when a\r\nman tells me that he has "seen the engravings which are upon the plates,"\r\nand not only that, but an angel was there at the time, and saw him see\r\nthem, and probably took his receipt for it, I am very far on the road to\r\nconviction, no matter whether I ever heard of that man before or not, and\r\neven if I do not know the name of the angel, or his nationality either.\r\n\r\nNext is this:\r\n\r\n      AND ALSO THE TESTIMONY OF EIGHT WITNESSES.\r\n      Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people unto\r\n      whom this work shall come, that Joseph Smith, Jr., the translator of\r\n      this work, has shown unto us the plates of which hath been spoken,\r\n      which have the appearance of gold; and as many of the leaves as the\r\n      said Smith has translated, we did handle with our hands; and we also\r\n      saw the engravings thereon, all of which has the appearance of\r\n      ancient work, and of curious workmanship.  And this we bear record\r\n      with words of soberness, that the said Smith has shown unto us, for\r\n      we have seen and hefted, and know of a surety that the said Smith\r\n      has got the plates of which we have spoken.  And we give our names\r\n      unto the world, to witness unto the world that which we have seen;\r\n      and we lie not, God bearing witness of it.\r\n                          CHRISTIAN WHITMER,\r\n                          JACOB WHITMER,\r\n                          PETER WHITMER, JR.,\r\n                          JOHN WHITMER,\r\n                          HIRAM PAGE,\r\n                          JOSEPH SMITH, SR.,\r\n                          HYRUM SMITH,\r\n                          SAMUEL H.  SMITH.\r\n\r\nAnd when I am far on the road to conviction, and eight men, be they\r\ngrammatical or otherwise, come forward and tell me that they have seen\r\nthe plates too; and not only seen those plates but "hefted" them, I am\r\nconvinced.  I could not feel more satisfied and at rest if the entire\r\nWhitmer family had testified.\r\n\r\nThe Mormon Bible consists of fifteen "books"--being the books of Jacob,\r\nEnos, Jarom, Omni, Mosiah, Zeniff, Alma, Helaman, Ether, Moroni, two\r\n"books" of Mormon, and three of Nephi.\r\n\r\nIn the first book of Nephi is a plagiarism of the Old Testament, which\r\ngives an account of the exodus from Jerusalem of the "children of Lehi";\r\nand it goes on to tell of their wanderings in the wilderness, during\r\neight years, and their supernatural protection by one of their number, a\r\nparty by the name of Nephi.  They finally reached the land of\r\n"Bountiful," and camped by the sea.  After they had remained there "for\r\nthe space of many days"--which is more Scriptural than definite--Nephi\r\nwas commanded from on high to build a ship wherein to "carry the people\r\nacross the waters."  He travestied Noah\'s ark--but he obeyed orders in\r\nthe matter of the plan.  He finished the ship in a single day, while his\r\nbrethren stood by and made fun of it--and of him, too--"saying, our\r\nbrother is a fool, for he thinketh that he can build a ship."  They did\r\nnot wait for the timbers to dry, but the whole tribe or nation sailed the\r\nnext day.  Then a bit of genuine nature cropped out, and is revealed by\r\noutspoken Nephi with Scriptural frankness--they all got on a spree!\r\nThey, "and also their wives, began to make themselves merry, insomuch\r\nthat they began to dance, and to sing, and to speak with much rudeness;\r\nyea, they were lifted up unto exceeding rudeness."\r\n\r\nNephi tried to stop these scandalous proceedings; but they tied him neck\r\nand heels, and went on with their lark.  But observe how Nephi the\r\nprophet circumvented them by the aid of the invisible powers:\r\n\r\n      And it came to pass that after they had bound me, insomuch that I\r\n      could not move, the compass, which had been prepared of the Lord,\r\n      did cease to work; wherefore, they knew not whither they should\r\n      steer the ship, insomuch that there arose a great storm, yea, a\r\n      great and terrible tempest, and we were driven back upon the waters\r\n      for the space of three days; and they began to be frightened\r\n      exceedingly, lest they should be drowned in the sea; nevertheless\r\n      they did not loose me.  And on the fourth day, which we had been\r\n      driven back, the tempest began to be exceeding sore.  And it came to\r\n      pass that we were about to be swallowed up in the depths of the sea.\r\n\r\nThen they untied him.\r\n\r\n      And it came to pass after they had loosed me, behold, I took the\r\n      compass, and it did work whither I desired it.  And it came to pass\r\n      that I prayed unto the Lord; and after I had prayed, the winds did\r\n      cease, and the storm did cease, and there was a great calm.\r\n\r\nEquipped with their compass, these ancients appear to have had the\r\nadvantage of Noah.\r\n\r\nTheir voyage was toward a "promised land"--the only name they give it.\r\nThey reached it in safety.\r\n\r\nPolygamy is a recent feature in the Mormon religion, and was added by\r\nBrigham Young after Joseph Smith\'s death.  Before that, it was regarded\r\nas an "abomination."  This verse from the Mormon Bible occurs in Chapter\r\nII. of the book of Jacob:\r\n\r\n      For behold, thus saith the Lord, this people begin to wax in\r\n      iniquity; they understand not the Scriptures; for they seek to\r\n      excuse themselves in committing whoredoms, because of the things\r\n      which were written concerning David, and Solomon his son.  Behold,\r\n      David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing\r\n      was abominable before me, saith the Lord; wherefore, thus saith the\r\n      Lord, I have led this people forth out of the land of Jerusalem, by\r\n      the power of mine arm, that I might raise up unto me a righteous\r\n      branch from the fruit of the loins of Joseph.  Wherefore, I the Lord\r\n      God, will no suffer that this people shall do like unto them of old.\r\n\r\nHowever, the project failed--or at least the modern Mormon end of it--for\r\nBrigham "suffers" it.  This verse is from the same chapter:\r\n\r\n      Behold, the Lamanites your brethren, whom ye hate, because of their\r\n      filthiness and the cursings which hath come upon their skins, are\r\n      more righteous than you; for they have not forgotten the commandment\r\n      of the Lord, which was given unto our fathers, that they should\r\n      have, save it were one wife; and concubines they should have none.\r\n\r\nThe following verse (from Chapter IX. of the Book of Nephi) appears to\r\ncontain information not familiar to everybody:\r\n\r\n      And now it came to pass that when Jesus had ascended into heaven,\r\n      the multitude did disperse, and every man did take his wife and his\r\n      children, and did return to his own home.\r\n\r\n      And it came to pass that on the morrow, when the multitude was\r\n      gathered together, behold, Nephi and his brother whom he had raised\r\n      from the dead, whose name was Timothy, and also his son, whose name\r\n      was Jonas, and also Mathoni, and Mathonihah, his brother, and Kumen,\r\n      and Kumenenhi, and Jeremiah, and Shemnon, and Jonas, and Zedekiah,\r\n      and Isaiah; now these were the names of the disciples whom Jesus had\r\n      chosen.\r\n\r\nIn order that the reader may observe how much more grandeur and\r\npicturesqueness (as seen by these Mormon twelve) accompanied on of the\r\ntenderest episodes in the life of our Saviour than other eyes seem to\r\nhave been aware of, I quote the following from the same "book"--Nephi:\r\n\r\n      And it came to pass that Jesus spake unto them, and bade them arise.\r\n      And they arose from the earth, and He said unto them, Blessed are ye\r\n      because of your faith.  And now behold, My joy is full.  And when He\r\n      had said these words, He wept, and the multitude bear record of it,\r\n      and He took their little children, one by one, and blessed them, and\r\n      prayed unto the Father for them.  And when He had done this He wept\r\n      again, and He spake unto the multitude, and saith unto them, Behold\r\n      your little ones.  And as they looked to behold, they cast their\r\n      eyes toward heaven, and they saw the heavens open, and they saw\r\n      angels descending out of heaven as it were, in the midst of fire;\r\n      and they came down and encircled those little ones about, and they\r\n      were encircled about with fire; and the angels did minister unto\r\n      them, and the multitude did see and hear and bear record; and they\r\n      know that their record is true, for they all of them did see and\r\n      hear, every man for himself; and they were in number about two\r\n      thousand and five hundred souls; and they did consist of men, women,\r\n      and children.\r\n\r\nAnd what else would they be likely to consist of?\r\n\r\nThe Book of Ether is an incomprehensible medley of if "history," much of\r\nit relating to battles and sieges among peoples whom the reader has\r\npossibly never heard of; and who inhabited a country which is not set\r\ndown in the geography.  These was a King with the remarkable name of\r\nCoriantumr, and he warred with Shared, and Lib, and Shiz, and others,\r\nin the "plains of Heshlon"; and the "valley of Gilgal"; and the\r\n"wilderness of Akish"; and the "land of Moran"; and the "plains of\r\nAgosh"; and "Ogath," and "Ramah," and the "land of Corihor," and the\r\n"hill Comnor," by "the waters of Ripliancum," etc., etc., etc.  "And it\r\ncame to pass," after a deal of fighting, that Coriantumr, upon making\r\ncalculation of his losses, found that "there had been slain two millions\r\nof mighty men, and also their wives and their children"--say 5,000,000 or\r\n6,000,000 in all--"and he began to sorrow in his heart."  Unquestionably\r\nit was time.  So he wrote to Shiz, asking a cessation of hostilities, and\r\noffering to give up his kingdom to save his people.  Shiz declined,\r\nexcept upon condition that Coriantumr would come and let him cut his head\r\noff first--a thing which Coriantumr would not do.  Then there was more\r\nfighting for a season; then four years were devoted to gathering the\r\nforces for a final struggle--after which ensued a battle, which, I take\r\nit, is the most remarkable set forth in history,--except, perhaps, that\r\nof the Kilkenny cats, which it resembles in some respects.  This is the\r\naccount of the gathering and the battle:\r\n\r\n      7.  And it came to pass that they did gather together all the\r\n      people, upon all the face of the land, who had not been slain, save\r\n      it was Ether.  And it came to pass that Ether did behold all the\r\n      doings of the people; and he beheld that the people who were for\r\n      Coriantumr, were gathered together to the army of Coriantumr; and\r\n      the people who were for Shiz, were gathered together to the army of\r\n      Shiz; wherefore they were for the space of four years gathering\r\n      together the people, that they might get all who were upon the face\r\n      of the land, and that they might receive all the strength which it\r\n      was possible that they could receive.  And it came to pass that when\r\n      they were all gathered together, every one to the army which he\r\n      would, with their wives and their children; both men, women, and\r\n      children being armed with weapons of war, having shields, and\r\n      breast-plates, and head-plates, and being clothed after the manner\r\n      of war, they did march forth one against another, to battle; and\r\n      they fought all that day, and conquered not.  And it came to pass\r\n      that when it was night they were weary, and retired to their camps;\r\n      and after they had retired to their camps, they took up a howling\r\n      and a lamentation for the loss of the slain of their people; and so\r\n      great were their cries, their howlings and lamentations, that it did\r\n      rend the air exceedingly.  And it came to pass that on the morrow\r\n      they did go again to battle, and great and terrible was that day;\r\n      nevertheless they conquered not, and when the night came again, they\r\n      did rend the air with their cries, and their howlings, and their\r\n      mournings, for the loss of the slain of their people.\r\n\r\n      8.  And it came to pass that Coriantumr wrote again an epistle unto\r\n      Shiz, desiring that he would not come again to battle, but that he\r\n      would take the kingdom, and spare the lives of the people.  But\r\n      behold, the Spirit of the Lord had ceased striving with them, and\r\n      Satan had full power over the hearts of the people, for they were\r\n      given up unto the hardness of their hearts, and the blindness of\r\n      their minds that they might be destroyed; wherefore they went again\r\n      to battle.  And it came to pass that they fought all that day, and\r\n      when the night came they slept upon their swords; and on the morrow\r\n      they fought even until the night came; and when the night came they\r\n      were drunken with anger, even as a man who is drunken with wine; and\r\n      they slept again upon their swords; and on the morrow they fought\r\n      again; and when the night came they had all fallen by the sword save\r\n      it were fifty and two of the people of Coriantumr, and sixty and\r\n      nine of the people of Shiz.  And it came to pass that they slept\r\n      upon their swords that night, and on the morrow they fought again,\r\n      and they contended in their mights with their swords, and with their\r\n      shields, all that day; and when the night came there were thirty and\r\n      two of the people of Shiz, and twenty and seven of the people of\r\n      Coriantumr.\r\n\r\n      9.  And it came to pass that they ate and slept, and prepared for\r\n      death on the morrow.  And they were large and mighty men, as to the\r\n      strength of men.  And it came to pass that they fought for the space\r\n      of three hours, and they fainted with the loss of blood.  And it\r\n      came to pass that when the men of Coriantumr had received sufficient\r\n      strength, that they could walk, they were about to flee for their\r\n      lives, but behold, Shiz arose, and also his men, and he swore in his\r\n      wrath that he would slay Coriantumr, or he would perish by the\r\n      sword: wherefore he did pursue them, and on the morrow he did\r\n      overtake them; and they fought again with the sword.  And it came to\r\n      pass that when they had all fallen by the sword, save it were\r\n      Coriantumr and Shiz, behold Shiz had fainted with loss of blood.\r\n      And it came to pass that when Coriantumr had leaned upon his sword,\r\n      that he rested a little, he smote off the head of Shiz.  And it came\r\n      to pass that after he had smote off the head of Shiz, that Shiz\r\n      raised upon his hands and fell; and after that he had struggled for\r\n      breath, he died.  And it came to pass that Coriantumr fell to the\r\n      earth, and became as if he had no life.  And the Lord spake unto\r\n      Ether, and said unto him, go forth.  And he went forth, and beheld\r\n      that the words of the Lord had all been fulfilled; and he finished\r\n      his record; and the hundredth part I have not written.\r\n\r\nIt seems a pity he did not finish, for after all his dreary former\r\nchapters of commonplace, he stopped just as he was in danger of becoming\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nThe Mormon Bible is rather stupid and tiresome to read, but there is\r\nnothing vicious in its teachings.  Its code of morals is unobjectionable\r\n--it is "smouched" [Milton] from the New Testament and no credit given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nAt the end of our two days\' sojourn, we left Great Salt Lake City hearty\r\nand well fed and happy--physically superb but not so very much wiser, as\r\nregards the "Mormon question," than we were when we arrived, perhaps.\r\nWe had a deal more "information" than we had before, of course, but we\r\ndid not know what portion of it was reliable and what was not--for it all\r\ncame from acquaintances of a day--strangers, strictly speaking.  We were\r\ntold, for instance, that the dreadful "Mountain Meadows Massacre" was the\r\nwork of the Indians entirely, and that the Gentiles had meanly tried to\r\nfasten it upon the Mormons; we were told, likewise, that the Indians were\r\nto blame, partly, and partly the Mormons; and we were told, likewise, and\r\njust as positively, that the Mormons were almost if not wholly and\r\ncompletely responsible for that most treacherous and pitiless butchery.\r\nWe got the story in all these different shapes, but it was not till\r\nseveral years afterward that Mrs. Waite\'s book, "The Mormon Prophet,"\r\ncame out with Judge Cradlebaugh\'s trial of the accused parties in it and\r\nrevealed the truth that the latter version was the correct one and that\r\nthe Mormons were the assassins.  All our "information" had three sides to\r\nit, and so I gave up the idea that I could settle the "Mormon question"\r\nin two days.  Still I have seen newspaper correspondents do it in one.\r\n\r\nI left Great Salt Lake a good deal confused as to what state of things\r\nexisted there--and sometimes even questioning in my own mind whether a\r\nstate of things existed there at all or not.  But presently I remembered\r\nwith a lightening sense of relief that we had learned two or three\r\ntrivial things there which we could be certain of; and so the two days\r\nwere not wholly lost.  For instance, we had learned that we were at last\r\nin a pioneer land, in absolute and tangible reality.\r\n\r\nThe high prices charged for trifles were eloquent of high freights and\r\nbewildering distances of freightage.  In the east, in those days, the\r\nsmallest moneyed denomination was a penny and it represented the smallest\r\npurchasable quantity of any commodity.  West of Cincinnati the smallest\r\ncoin in use was the silver five-cent piece and no smaller quantity of an\r\narticle could be bought than "five cents\' worth."  In Overland City the\r\nlowest coin appeared to be the ten-cent piece; but in Salt Lake there did\r\nnot seem to be any money in circulation smaller than a quarter, or any\r\nsmaller quantity purchasable of any commodity than twenty-five cents\'\r\nworth.  We had always been used to half dimes and "five cents\' worth" as\r\nthe minimum of financial negotiations; but in Salt Lake if one wanted a\r\ncigar, it was a quarter; if he wanted a chalk pipe, it was a quarter; if\r\nhe wanted a peach, or a candle, or a newspaper, or a shave, or a little\r\nGentile whiskey to rub on his corns to arrest indigestion and keep him\r\nfrom having the toothache, twenty-five cents was the price, every time.\r\nWhen we looked at the shot-bag of silver, now and then, we seemed to be\r\nwasting our substance in riotous living, but if we referred to the\r\nexpense account we could see that we had not been doing anything of the\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nBut people easily get reconciled to big money and big prices, and fond\r\nand vain of both--it is a descent to little coins and cheap prices that\r\nis hardest to bear and slowest to take hold upon one\'s toleration.  After\r\na month\'s acquaintance with the twenty-five cent minimum, the average\r\nhuman being is ready to blush every time he thinks of his despicable\r\nfive-cent days.  How sunburnt with blushes I used to get in gaudy Nevada,\r\nevery time I thought of my first financial experience in Salt Lake.\r\nIt was on this wise (which is a favorite expression of great authors, and\r\na very neat one, too, but I never hear anybody say on this wise when they\r\nare talking).  A young half-breed with a complexion like a yellow-jacket\r\nasked me if I would have my boots blacked.  It was at the Salt Lake House\r\nthe morning after we arrived.  I said yes, and he blacked them.  Then I\r\nhanded him a silver five-cent piece, with the benevolent air of a person\r\nwho is conferring wealth and blessedness upon poverty and suffering.  The\r\nyellow-jacket took it with what I judged to be suppressed emotion, and\r\nlaid it reverently down in the middle of his broad hand.  Then he began\r\nto contemplate it, much as a philosopher contemplates a gnat\'s ear in the\r\nample field of his microscope.  Several mountaineers, teamsters,\r\nstage-drivers, etc., drew near and dropped into the tableau and fell to\r\nsurveying the money with that attractive indifference to formality which\r\nis noticeable in the hardy pioneer.  Presently the yellow-jacket handed\r\nthe half dime back to me and told me I ought to keep my money in my\r\npocket-book instead of in my soul, and then I wouldn\'t get it cramped and\r\nshriveled up so!\r\n\r\nWhat a roar of vulgar laughter there was!  I destroyed the mongrel\r\nreptile on the spot, but I smiled and smiled all the time I was detaching\r\nhis scalp, for the remark he made was good for an "Injun."\r\n\r\nYes, we had learned in Salt Lake to be charged great prices without\r\nletting the inward shudder appear on the surface--for even already we had\r\noverheard and noted the tenor of conversations among drivers, conductors,\r\nand hostlers, and finally among citizens of Salt Lake, until we were well\r\naware that these superior beings despised "emigrants."  We permitted no\r\ntell-tale shudders and winces in our countenances, for we wanted to seem\r\npioneers, or Mormons, half-breeds, teamsters, stage-drivers, Mountain\r\nMeadow assassins--anything in the world that the plains and Utah\r\nrespected and admired--but we were wretchedly ashamed of being\r\n"emigrants," and sorry enough that we had white shirts and could not\r\nswear in the presence of ladies without looking the other way.\r\n\r\nAnd many a time in Nevada, afterwards, we had occasion to remember with\r\nhumiliation that we were "emigrants," and consequently a low and inferior\r\nsort of creatures.  Perhaps the reader has visited Utah, Nevada, or\r\nCalifornia, even in these latter days, and while communing with himself\r\nupon the sorrowful banishment of these countries from what he considers\r\n"the world," has had his wings clipped by finding that he is the one to\r\nbe pitied, and that there are entire populations around him ready and\r\nwilling to do it for him--yea, who are complacently doing it for him\r\nalready, wherever he steps his foot.\r\n\r\nPoor thing, they are making fun of his hat; and the cut of his New York\r\ncoat; and his conscientiousness about his grammar; and his feeble\r\nprofanity; and his consumingly ludicrous ignorance of ores, shafts,\r\ntunnels, and other things which he never saw before, and never felt\r\nenough interest in to read about.  And all the time that he is thinking\r\nwhat a sad fate it is to be exiled to that far country, that lonely land,\r\nthe citizens around him are looking down on him with a blighting\r\ncompassion because he is an "emigrant" instead of that proudest and\r\nblessedest creature that exists on all the earth, a "FORTY-NINER."\r\n\r\nThe accustomed coach life began again, now, and by midnight it almost\r\nseemed as if we never had been out of our snuggery among the mail sacks\r\nat all.  We had made one alteration, however.  We had provided enough\r\nbread, boiled ham and hard boiled eggs to last double the six hundred\r\nmiles of staging we had still to do.\r\n\r\nAnd it was comfort in those succeeding days to sit up and contemplate the\r\nmajestic panorama of mountains and valleys spread out below us and eat\r\nham and hard boiled eggs while our spiritual natures revelled alternately\r\nin rainbows, thunderstorms, and peerless sunsets.  Nothing helps scenery\r\nlike ham and eggs.  Ham and eggs, and after these a pipe--an old, rank,\r\ndelicious pipe--ham and eggs and scenery, a "down grade," a flying coach,\r\na fragrant pipe and a contented heart--these make happiness.  It is what\r\nall the ages have struggled for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nAt eight in the morning we reached the remnant and ruin of what had been\r\nthe important military station of "Camp Floyd," some forty-five or fifty\r\nmiles from Salt Lake City.  At four P.M.  we had doubled our distance and\r\nwere ninety or a hundred miles from Salt Lake.  And now we entered upon\r\none of that species of deserts whose concentrated hideousness shames the\r\ndiffused and diluted horrors of Sahara--an "alkali" desert.  For\r\nsixty-eight miles there was but one break in it.  I do not remember that\r\nthis was really a break; indeed it seems to me that it was nothing but a\r\nwatering depot in the midst of the stretch of sixty-eight miles.  If my\r\nmemory serves me, there was no well or spring at this place, but the\r\nwater was hauled there by mule and ox teams from the further side of the\r\ndesert.  There was a stage station there.  It was forty-five miles from\r\nthe beginning of the desert, and twenty-three from the end of it.\r\n\r\nWe plowed and dragged and groped along, the whole live-long night,\r\nand at the end of this uncomfortable twelve hours we finished the\r\nforty-five-mile part of the desert and got to the stage station where the\r\nimported water was.  The sun was just rising.  It was easy enough to\r\ncross a desert in the night while we were asleep; and it was pleasant to\r\nreflect, in the morning, that we in actual person had encountered an\r\nabsolute desert and could always speak knowingly of deserts in presence\r\nof the ignorant thenceforward.  And it was pleasant also to reflect that\r\nthis was not an obscure, back country desert, but a very celebrated one,\r\nthe metropolis itself, as you may say.  All this was very well and very\r\ncomfortable and satisfactory--but now we were to cross a desert in\r\ndaylight.  This was fine--novel--romantic--dramatically adventurous\r\n--this, indeed, was worth living for, worth traveling for!  We would\r\nwrite home all about it.\r\n\r\nThis enthusiasm, this stern thirst for adventure, wilted under the sultry\r\nAugust sun and did not last above one hour.  One poor little hour--and\r\nthen we were ashamed that we had "gushed" so.  The poetry was all in the\r\nanticipation--there is none in the reality.  Imagine a vast, waveless\r\nocean stricken dead and turned to ashes; imagine this solemn waste tufted\r\nwith ash-dusted sage-bushes; imagine the lifeless silence and solitude\r\nthat belong to such a place; imagine a coach, creeping like a bug through\r\nthe midst of this shoreless level, and sending up tumbled volumes of dust\r\nas if it were a bug that went by steam; imagine this aching monotony of\r\ntoiling and plowing kept up hour after hour, and the shore still as far\r\naway as ever, apparently; imagine team, driver, coach and passengers so\r\ndeeply coated with ashes that they are all one colorless color; imagine\r\nash-drifts roosting above moustaches and eyebrows like snow accumulations\r\non boughs and bushes.  This is the reality of it.\r\n\r\nThe sun beats down with dead, blistering, relentless malignity; the\r\nperspiration is welling from every pore in man and beast, but scarcely a\r\nsign of it finds its way to the surface--it is absorbed before it gets\r\nthere; there is not the faintest breath of air stirring; there is not a\r\nmerciful shred of cloud in all the brilliant firmament; there is not a\r\nliving creature visible in any direction whither one searches the blank\r\nlevel that stretches its monotonous miles on every hand; there is not a\r\nsound--not a sigh--not a whisper--not a buzz, or a whir of wings, or\r\ndistant pipe of bird--not even a sob from the lost souls that doubtless\r\npeople that dead air.  And so the occasional sneezing of the resting\r\nmules, and the champing of the bits, grate harshly on the grim stillness,\r\nnot dissipating the spell but accenting it and making one feel more\r\nlonesome and forsaken than before.\r\n\r\nThe mules, under violent swearing, coaxing and whip-cracking, would make\r\nat stated intervals a "spurt," and drag the coach a hundred or may be two\r\nhundred yards, stirring up a billowy cloud of dust that rolled back,\r\nenveloping the vehicle to the wheel-tops or higher, and making it seem\r\nafloat in a fog.  Then a rest followed, with the usual sneezing and\r\nbit-champing.  Then another "spurt" of a hundred yards and another rest at\r\nthe end of it.  All day long we kept this up, without water for the mules\r\nand without ever changing the team.  At least we kept it up ten hours,\r\nwhich, I take it, is a day, and a pretty honest one, in an alkali desert.\r\nIt was from four in the morning till two in the afternoon.  And it was so\r\nhot! and so close! and our water canteens went dry in the middle of the\r\nday and we got so thirsty!  It was so stupid and tiresome and dull! and\r\nthe tedious hours did lag and drag and limp along with such a cruel\r\ndeliberation!  It was so trying to give one\'s watch a good long\r\nundisturbed spell and then take it out and find that it had been fooling\r\naway the time and not trying to get ahead any!  The alkali dust cut\r\nthrough our lips, it persecuted our eyes, it ate through the delicate\r\nmembranes and made our noses bleed and kept them bleeding--and truly and\r\nseriously the romance all faded far away and disappeared, and left the\r\ndesert trip nothing but a harsh reality--a thirsty, sweltering, longing,\r\nhateful reality!\r\n\r\nTwo miles and a quarter an hour for ten hours--that was what we\r\naccomplished.  It was hard to bring the comprehension away down to such a\r\nsnail-pace as that, when we had been used to making eight and ten miles\r\nan hour.  When we reached the station on the farther verge of the desert,\r\nwe were glad, for the first time, that the dictionary was along, because\r\nwe never could have found language to tell how glad we were, in any sort\r\nof dictionary but an unabridged one with pictures in it.  But there could\r\nnot have been found in a whole library of dictionaries language\r\nsufficient to tell how tired those mules were after their twenty-three\r\nmile pull.  To try to give the reader an idea of how thirsty they were,\r\nwould be to "gild refined gold or paint the lily."\r\n\r\nSomehow, now that it is there, the quotation does not seem to fit--but no\r\nmatter, let it stay, anyhow.  I think it is a graceful and attractive\r\nthing, and therefore have tried time and time again to work it in where\r\nit would fit, but could not succeed.  These efforts have kept my mind\r\ndistracted and ill at ease, and made my narrative seem broken and\r\ndisjointed, in places.  Under these circumstances it seems to me best to\r\nleave it in, as above, since this will afford at least a temporary\r\nrespite from the wear and tear of trying to "lead up" to this really apt\r\nand beautiful quotation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the sixteenth day out from St. Joseph we arrived at the\r\nentrance of Rocky Canyon, two hundred and fifty miles from Salt Lake.\r\nIt was along in this wild country somewhere, and far from any habitation\r\nof white men, except the stage stations, that we came across the\r\nwretchedest type of mankind I have ever seen, up to this writing.  I\r\nrefer to the Goshoot Indians.  From what we could see and all we could\r\nlearn, they are very considerably inferior to even the despised Digger\r\nIndians of California; inferior to all races of savages on our continent;\r\ninferior to even the Terra del Fuegans; inferior to the Hottentots, and\r\nactually inferior in some respects to the Kytches of Africa.  Indeed, I\r\nhave been obliged to look the bulky volumes of Wood\'s "Uncivilized Races\r\nof Men" clear through in order to find a savage tribe degraded enough to\r\ntake rank with the Goshoots.  I find but one people fairly open to that\r\nshameful verdict.  It is the Bosjesmans (Bushmen) of South Africa.  Such\r\nof the Goshoots as we saw, along the road and hanging about the stations,\r\nwere small, lean, "scrawny" creatures; in complexion a dull black like\r\nthe ordinary American negro; their faces and hands bearing dirt which\r\nthey had been hoarding and accumulating for months, years, and even\r\ngenerations, according to the age of the proprietor; a silent, sneaking,\r\ntreacherous looking race; taking note of everything, covertly, like all\r\nthe other "Noble Red Men" that we (do not) read about, and betraying no\r\nsign in their countenances; indolent, everlastingly patient and tireless,\r\nlike all other Indians; prideless beggars--for if the beggar instinct\r\nwere left out of an Indian he would not "go," any more than a clock\r\nwithout a pendulum; hungry, always hungry, and yet never refusing\r\nanything that a hog would eat, though often eating what a hog would\r\ndecline; hunters, but having no higher ambition than to kill and eat\r\njack-ass rabbits,  crickets and grasshoppers, and embezzle carrion from\r\nthe buzzards and cayotes; savages who, when asked if they have the common\r\nIndian belief in a Great Spirit show a something which almost amounts to\r\nemotion, thinking whiskey is referred to; a thin, scattering race of\r\nalmost naked black children, these Goshoots are, who produce nothing at\r\nall, and have no villages, and no gatherings together into strictly\r\ndefined tribal communities--a people whose only shelter is a rag cast on\r\na bush to keep off a portion of the snow, and yet who inhabit one of the\r\nmost rocky, wintry, repulsive wastes that our country or any other can\r\nexhibit.\r\n\r\nThe Bushmen and our Goshoots are manifestly descended from the self-same\r\ngorilla, or kangaroo, or Norway rat, which-ever animal--Adam the\r\nDarwinians trace them to.\r\n\r\nOne would as soon expect the rabbits to fight as the Goshoots, and yet\r\nthey used to live off the offal and refuse of the stations a few months\r\nand then come some dark night when no mischief was expected, and burn\r\ndown the buildings and kill the men from ambush as they rushed out.\r\nAnd once, in the night, they attacked the stage-coach when a District\r\nJudge, of Nevada Territory, was the only passenger, and with their first\r\nvolley of arrows (and a bullet or two) they riddled the stage curtains,\r\nwounded a horse or two and mortally wounded the driver.  The latter was\r\nfull of pluck, and so was his passenger.  At the driver\'s call Judge Mott\r\nswung himself out, clambered to the box and seized the reins of the team,\r\nand away they plunged, through the racing mob of skeletons and under a\r\nhurtling storm of missiles.  The stricken driver had sunk down on the\r\nboot as soon as he was wounded, but had held on to the reins and said he\r\nwould manage to keep hold of them until relieved.\r\n\r\nAnd after they were taken from his relaxing grasp, he lay with his head\r\nbetween Judge Mott\'s feet, and tranquilly gave directions about the road;\r\nhe said he believed he could live till the miscreants were outrun and\r\nleft behind, and that if he managed that, the main difficulty would be at\r\nan end, and then if the Judge drove so and so (giving directions about\r\nbad places in the road, and general course) he would reach the next\r\nstation without trouble.  The Judge distanced the enemy and at last\r\nrattled up to the station and knew that the night\'s perils were done; but\r\nthere was no comrade-in-arms for him to rejoice with, for the soldierly\r\ndriver was dead.\r\n\r\nLet us forget that we have been saying harsh things about the Overland\r\ndrivers, now.  The disgust which the Goshoots gave me, a disciple of\r\nCooper and a worshipper of the Red Man--even of the scholarly savages in\r\nthe "Last of the Mohicans" who are fittingly associated with backwoodsmen\r\nwho divide each sentence into two equal parts: one part critically\r\ngrammatical, refined and choice of language, and the other part just such\r\nan attempt to talk like a hunter or a mountaineer, as a Broadway clerk\r\nmight make after eating an edition of Emerson Bennett\'s works and\r\nstudying frontier life at the Bowery Theatre a couple of weeks--I say\r\nthat the nausea which the Goshoots gave me, an Indian worshipper, set me\r\nto examining authorities, to see if perchance I had been over-estimating\r\nthe Red Man while viewing him through the mellow moonshine of romance.\r\nThe revelations that came were disenchanting.  It was curious to see how\r\nquickly the paint and tinsel fell away from him and left him treacherous,\r\nfilthy and repulsive--and how quickly the evidences accumulated that\r\nwherever one finds an Indian tribe he has only found Goshoots more or\r\nless modified by circumstances and surroundings--but Goshoots, after all.\r\nThey deserve pity, poor creatures; and they can have mine--at this\r\ndistance.  Nearer by, they never get anybody\'s.\r\n\r\nThere is an impression abroad that the Baltimore and Washington Railroad\r\nCompany and many of its employees are Goshoots; but it is an error.\r\nThere is only a plausible resemblance, which, while it is apt enough to\r\nmislead the ignorant, cannot deceive parties who have contemplated both\r\ntribes.  But seriously, it was not only poor wit, but very wrong to start\r\nthe report referred to above; for however innocent the motive may have\r\nbeen, the necessary effect was to injure the reputation of a class who\r\nhave a hard enough time of it in the pitiless deserts of the Rocky\r\nMountains, Heaven knows!  If we cannot find it in our hearts to give\r\nthose poor naked creatures our Christian sympathy and compassion, in\r\nGod\'s name let us at least not throw mud at them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth day we passed the highest mountain peaks we had yet\r\nseen, and although the day was very warm the night that followed upon its\r\nheels was wintry cold and blankets were next to useless.\r\n\r\nOn the eighteenth day we encountered the eastward-bound\r\ntelegraph-constructors at Reese River station and sent a message to his\r\nExcellency Gov. Nye at Carson City (distant one hundred and fifty-six\r\nmiles).\r\n\r\nOn the nineteenth day we crossed the Great American Desert--forty\r\nmemorable miles of bottomless sand, into which the coach wheels sunk from\r\nsix inches to a foot.  We worked our passage most of the way across.\r\nThat is to say, we got out and walked.  It was a dreary pull and a long\r\nand thirsty one, for we had no water.  From one extremity of this desert\r\nto the other, the road was white with the bones of oxen and horses.\r\nIt would hardly be an exaggeration to say that we could have walked the\r\nforty miles and set our feet on a bone at every step!  The desert was one\r\nprodigious graveyard.  And the log-chains, wagon tyres, and rotting\r\nwrecks of vehicles were almost as thick as the bones.  I think we saw\r\nlog-chains enough rusting there in the desert, to reach across any State\r\nin the Union.  Do not these relics suggest something of an idea of the\r\nfearful suffering and privation the early emigrants to California\r\nendured?\r\n\r\nAt the border of the Desert lies Carson Lake, or The "Sink" of the\r\nCarson, a shallow, melancholy sheet of water some eighty or a hundred\r\nmiles in circumference.  Carson River empties into it and is lost--sinks\r\nmysteriously into the earth and never appears in the light of the sun\r\nagain--for the lake has no outlet whatever.\r\n\r\nThere are several rivers in Nevada, and they all have this mysterious\r\nfate.  They end in various lakes or "sinks," and that is the last of\r\nthem.  Carson Lake, Humboldt Lake, Walker Lake, Mono Lake, are all great\r\nsheets of water without any visible outlet.  Water is always flowing into\r\nthem; none is ever seen to flow out of them, and yet they remain always\r\nlevel full, neither receding nor overflowing.  What they do with their\r\nsurplus is only known to the Creator.\r\n\r\nOn the western verge of the Desert we halted a moment at Ragtown.  It\r\nconsisted of one log house and is not set down on the map.\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of a circumstance.  Just after we left Julesburg, on the\r\nPlatte, I was sitting with the driver, and he said:\r\n\r\n"I can tell you a most laughable thing indeed, if you would like to\r\nlisten to it.  Horace Greeley went over this road once.  When he was\r\nleaving Carson City he told the driver, Hank Monk, that he had an\r\nengagement to lecture at Placerville and was very anxious to go through\r\nquick.  Hank Monk cracked his whip and started off at an awful pace.\r\nThe coach bounced up and down in such a terrific way that it jolted the\r\nbuttons all off of Horace\'s coat, and finally shot his head clean through\r\nthe roof of the stage, and then he yelled at Hank Monk and begged him to\r\ngo easier--said he warn\'t in as much of a hurry as he was awhile ago.\r\nBut Hank Monk said, \'Keep your seat, Horace, and I\'ll get you there on\r\ntime\'--and you bet you he did, too, what was left of him!"\r\n\r\nA day or two after that we picked up a Denver man at the cross roads, and\r\nhe told us a good deal about the country and the Gregory Diggings.\r\nHe seemed a very entertaining person and a man well posted in the affairs\r\nof Colorado.  By and by he remarked:\r\n\r\n"I can tell you a most laughable thing indeed, if you would like to\r\nlisten to it.  Horace Greeley went over this road once.  When he was\r\nleaving Carson City he told the driver, Hank Monk, that he had an\r\nengagement to lecture at Placerville and was very anxious to go through\r\nquick.  Hank Monk cracked his whip and started off at an awful pace.  The\r\ncoach bounced up and down in such a terrific way that it jolted the\r\nbuttons all off of Horace\'s coat, and finally shot his head clean through\r\nthe roof of the stage, and then he yelled at Hank Monk and begged him to\r\ngo easier--said he warn\'t in as much of a hurry as he was awhile ago.\r\nBut Hank Monk said, \'Keep your seat, Horace, and I\'ll get you there on\r\ntime!\'--and you bet you he did, too, what was left of him!"\r\n\r\nAt Fort Bridger, some days after this, we took on board a cavalry\r\nsergeant, a very proper and soldierly person indeed.  From no other man\r\nduring the whole journey, did we gather such a store of concise and\r\nwell-arranged military information.  It was surprising to find in the\r\ndesolate wilds of our country a man so thoroughly acquainted with\r\neverything useful to know in his line of life, and yet of such inferior\r\nrank and unpretentious bearing.  For as much as three hours we listened\r\nto him with unabated interest.  Finally he got upon the subject of\r\ntrans-continental travel, and presently said:\r\n\r\n"I can tell you a very laughable thing indeed, if you would like to\r\nlisten to it.  Horace Greeley went over this road once.  When he was\r\nleaving Carson City he told the driver, Hank Monk, that he had an\r\nengagement to lecture at Placerville and was very anxious to go through\r\nquick.

I can never forget the pathos\r\nthat was in his voice as he told, in simple language, the story of his\r\npeople\'s wanderings and unpitied sufferings.  No pulpit eloquence was\r\never so moving and so beautiful as this outcast\'s picture of the first\r\nMormon pilgrimage across the plains, struggling sorrowfully onward to the\r\nland of its banishment and marking its desolate way with graves and\r\nwatering it with tears.  His words so wrought upon us that it was a\r\nrelief to us all when the conversation drifted into a more cheerful\r\nchannel and the natural features of the curious country we were in came\r\nunder treatment.  One matter after another was pleasantly discussed, and\r\nat length the stranger said:\r\n\r\n"I can tell you a most laughable thing indeed, if you would like to\r\nlisten to it.  Horace Greeley went over this road once.  When he was\r\nleaving Carson City he told the driver, Hank Monk, that he had an\r\nengagement to lecture in Placerville, and was very anxious to go through\r\nquick.  Hank Monk cracked his whip and started off at an awful pace.  The\r\ncoach bounced up and down in such a terrific way that it jolted the\r\nbuttons all off of Horace\'s coat, and finally shot his head clean through\r\nthe roof of the stage, and then he yelled at Hank Monk and begged him to\r\ngo easier--said he warn\'t in as much of a hurry as he was awhile ago.\r\nBut Hank Monk said, \'Keep your seat, Horace, and I\'ll get you there on\r\ntime!\'--and you bet you bet you he did, too, what was left of him!"\r\n\r\nTen miles out of Ragtown we found a poor wanderer who had lain down to\r\ndie.  He had walked as long as he could, but his limbs had failed him at\r\nlast.  Hunger and fatigue had conquered him.  It would have been inhuman\r\nto leave him there.  We paid his fare to Carson and lifted him into the\r\ncoach.  It was some little time before he showed any very decided signs\r\nof life; but by dint of chafing him and pouring brandy between his lips\r\nwe finally brought him to a languid consciousness.  Then we fed him a\r\nlittle, and by and by he seemed to comprehend the situation and a\r\ngrateful light softened his eye.  We made his mail-sack bed as\r\ncomfortable as possible, and constructed a pillow for him with our coats.\r\nHe seemed very thankful.  Then he looked up in our faces, and said in a\r\nfeeble voice that had a tremble of honest emotion in it:\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, I know not who you are, but you have saved my life; and\r\nalthough I can never be able to repay you for it, I feel that I can at\r\nleast make one hour of your long journey lighter.  I take it you are\r\nstrangers to this great thorough fare, but I am entirely familiar with\r\nit.  In this connection I can tell you a most laughable thing indeed, if\r\nyou would like to listen to it.  Horace Greeley----"\r\n\r\nI said, impressively:\r\n\r\n"Suffering stranger, proceed at your peril.  You see in me the melancholy\r\nwreck of a once stalwart and magnificent manhood.  What has brought me to\r\nthis?  That thing which you are about to tell.  Gradually but surely,\r\nthat tiresome old anecdote has sapped my strength, undermined my\r\nconstitution, withered my life.  Pity my helplessness.  Spare me only\r\njust this once, and tell me about young George Washington and his little\r\nhatchet for a change."\r\n\r\nWe were saved.  But not so the invalid.  In trying to retain the anecdote\r\nin his system he strained himself and died in our arms.\r\n\r\nI am aware, now, that I ought not to have asked of the sturdiest citizen\r\nof all that region, what I asked of that mere shadow of a man; for, after\r\nseven years\' residence on the Pacific coast, I know that no passenger or\r\ndriver on the Overland ever corked that anecdote in, when a stranger was\r\nby, and survived.  Within a period of six years I crossed and recrossed\r\nthe Sierras between Nevada and California thirteen times by stage and\r\nlistened to that deathless incident four hundred and eighty-one or\r\neighty-two times.  I have the list somewhere.  Drivers always told it,\r\nconductors told it, landlords told it, chance passengers told it, the\r\nvery Chinamen and vagrant Indians recounted it.  I have had the same\r\ndriver tell it to me two or three times in the same afternoon.  It has\r\ncome to me in all the multitude of tongues that Babel bequeathed to\r\nearth, and flavored with whiskey, brandy, beer, cologne, sozodont,\r\ntobacco, garlic, onions, grasshoppers--everything that has a fragrance to\r\nit through all the long list of things that are gorged or guzzled by the\r\nsons of men.  I never have smelt any anecdote as often as I have smelt\r\nthat one; never have smelt any anecdote that smelt so variegated as that\r\none.  And you never could learn to know it by its smell, because every\r\ntime you thought you had learned the smell of it, it would turn up with a\r\ndifferent smell.  Bayard Taylor has written about this hoary anecdote,\r\nRichardson has published it; so have Jones, Smith, Johnson, Ross Browne,\r\nand every other correspondence-inditing being that ever set his foot upon\r\nthe great overland road anywhere between Julesburg and San Francisco; and\r\nI have heard that it is in the Talmud.  I have seen it in print in nine\r\ndifferent foreign languages; I have been told that it is employed in the\r\ninquisition in Rome; and I now learn with regret that it is going to be\r\nset to music.  I do not think that such things are right.\r\n\r\nStage-coaching on the Overland is no more, and stage drivers are a race\r\ndefunct.  I wonder if they bequeathed that bald-headed anecdote to their\r\nsuccessors, the railroad brakemen and conductors, and if these latter\r\nstill persecute the helpless passenger with it until he concludes, as did\r\nmany a tourist of other days, that the real grandeurs of the Pacific\r\ncoast are not Yo Semite and the Big Trees, but Hank Monk and his\r\nadventure with Horace Greeley.  [And what makes that worn anecdote the\r\nmore aggravating, is, that the adventure it celebrates never occurred.\r\nIf it were a good anecdote, that seeming demerit would be its chiefest\r\nvirtue, for creative power belongs to greatness; but what ought to be\r\ndone to a man who would wantonly contrive so flat a one as this?  If I\r\nwere to suggest what ought to be done to him, I should be called\r\nextravagant--but what does the sixteenth chapter of Daniel say?  Aha!]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nWe were approaching the end of our long journey.  It was the morning of\r\nthe twentieth day.  At noon we would reach Carson City, the capital of\r\nNevada Territory.  We were not glad, but sorry.  It had been a fine\r\npleasure trip; we had fed fat on wonders every day; we were now well\r\naccustomed to stage life, and very fond of it; so the idea of coming to a\r\nstand-still and settling down to a humdrum existence in a village was not\r\nagreeable, but on the contrary depressing.\r\n\r\nVisibly our new home was a desert, walled in by barren, snow-clad\r\nmountains.  There was not a tree in sight.  There was no vegetation but\r\nthe endless sage-brush and greasewood.  All nature was gray with it.  We\r\nwere plowing through great deeps of powdery alkali dust that rose in\r\nthick clouds and floated across the plain like smoke from a burning\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nWe were coated with it like millers; so were the coach, the mules, the\r\nmail-bags, the driver--we and the sage-brush and the other scenery were\r\nall one monotonous color.  Long trains of freight wagons in the distance\r\nenvelope in ascending masses of dust suggested pictures of prairies on\r\nfire.  These teams and their masters were the only life we saw.\r\nOtherwise we moved in the midst of solitude, silence and desolation.\r\nEvery twenty steps we passed the skeleton of some dead beast of burthen,\r\nwith its dust-coated skin stretched tightly over its empty ribs.\r\nFrequently a solemn raven sat upon the skull or the hips and contemplated\r\nthe passing coach with meditative serenity.\r\n\r\nBy and by Carson City was pointed out to us.  It nestled in the edge of a\r\ngreat plain and was a sufficient number of miles away to look like an\r\nassemblage of mere white spots in the shadow of a grim range of mountains\r\noverlooking it, whose summits seemed lifted clear out of companionship\r\nand consciousness of earthly things.\r\n\r\nWe arrived, disembarked, and the stage went on.  It was a "wooden" town;\r\nits population two thousand souls.  The main street consisted of four or\r\nfive blocks of little white frame stores which were too high to sit down\r\non, but not too high for various other purposes; in fact, hardly high\r\nenough.  They were packed close together, side by side, as if room were\r\nscarce in that mighty plain.\r\n\r\nThe sidewalk was of boards that were more or less loose and inclined to\r\nrattle when walked upon.  In the middle of the town, opposite the stores,\r\nwas the "plaza" which is native to all towns beyond the Rocky Mountains\r\n--a large, unfenced, level vacancy, with a liberty pole in it, and very\r\nuseful as a place for public auctions, horse trades, and mass meetings,\r\nand likewise for teamsters to camp in.  Two other sides of the plaza were\r\nfaced by stores, offices and stables.\r\n\r\nThe rest of Carson City was pretty scattering.\r\n\r\nWe were introduced to several citizens, at the stage-office and on the\r\nway up to the Governor\'s from the hotel--among others, to a Mr. Harris,\r\nwho was on horseback; he began to say something, but interrupted himself\r\nwith the remark:\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have to get you to excuse me a minute; yonder is the witness that\r\nswore I helped to rob the California coach--a piece of impertinent\r\nintermeddling, sir, for I am not even acquainted with the man."\r\n\r\nThen he rode over and began to rebuke the stranger with a six-shooter,\r\nand the stranger began to explain with another.  When the pistols were\r\nemptied, the stranger resumed his work (mending a whip-lash), and Mr.\r\nHarris rode by with a polite nod, homeward bound, with a bullet through\r\none of his lungs, and several in his hips; and from them issued little\r\nrivulets of blood that coursed down the horse\'s sides and made the animal\r\nlook quite picturesque.  I never saw Harris shoot a man after that but it\r\nrecalled to mind that first day in Carson.\r\n\r\nThis was all we saw that day, for it was two o\'clock, now, and according\r\nto custom the daily "Washoe Zephyr" set in; a soaring dust-drift about\r\nthe size of the United States set up edgewise came with it, and the\r\ncapital of Nevada Territory disappeared from view.\r\n\r\nStill, there were sights to be seen which were not wholly uninteresting\r\nto new comers; for the vast dust cloud was thickly freckled with things\r\nstrange to the upper air--things living and dead, that flitted hither and\r\nthither, going and coming, appearing and disappearing among the rolling\r\nbillows of dust--hats, chickens and parasols sailing in the remote\r\nheavens; blankets, tin signs, sage-brush and shingles a shade lower;\r\ndoor-mats and buffalo robes lower still; shovels and coal scuttles on the\r\nnext grade; glass doors, cats and little children on the next; disrupted\r\nlumber yards, light buggies and wheelbarrows on the next; and down only\r\nthirty or forty feet above ground was a scurrying storm of emigrating\r\nroofs and vacant lots.\r\n\r\nIt was something to see that much.  I could have seen more, if I could\r\nhave kept the dust out of my eyes.\r\n\r\nBut seriously a Washoe wind is by no means a trifling matter.  It blows\r\nflimsy houses down, lifts shingle roofs occasionally, rolls up tin ones\r\nlike sheet music, now and then blows a stage coach over and spills the\r\npassengers; and tradition says the reason there are so many bald people\r\nthere, is, that the wind blows the hair off their heads while they are\r\nlooking skyward after their hats.  Carson streets seldom look inactive on\r\nSummer afternoons, because there are so many citizens skipping around\r\ntheir escaping hats, like chambermaids trying to head off a spider.\r\n\r\nThe "Washoe Zephyr" (Washoe is a pet nickname for Nevada) is a peculiar\r\nScriptural wind, in that no man knoweth "whence it cometh."  That is to\r\nsay, where it originates.  It comes right over the mountains from the\r\nWest, but when one crosses the ridge he does not find any of it on the\r\nother side!  It probably is manufactured on the mountain-top for the\r\noccasion, and starts from there.  It is a pretty regular wind, in the\r\nsummer time.  Its office hours are from two in the afternoon till two the\r\nnext morning; and anybody venturing abroad during those twelve hours\r\nneeds to allow for the wind or he will bring up a mile or two to leeward\r\nof the point he is aiming at.  And yet the first complaint a Washoe\r\nvisitor to San Francisco makes, is that the sea winds blow so, there!\r\nThere is a good deal of human nature in that.\r\n\r\nWe found the state palace of the Governor of Nevada Territory to consist\r\nof a white frame one-story house with two small rooms in it and a\r\nstanchion supported shed in front--for grandeur--it compelled the respect\r\nof the citizen and inspired the Indians with awe.  The newly arrived\r\nChief and Associate Justices of the Territory, and other machinery of the\r\ngovernment, were domiciled with less splendor.  They were boarding around\r\nprivately, and had their offices in their bedrooms.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary and I took quarters in the "ranch" of a worthy French lady\r\nby the name of Bridget O\'Flannigan, a camp follower of his Excellency the\r\nGovernor.  She had known him in his prosperity as commander-in-chief of\r\nthe Metropolitan Police of New York, and she would not desert him in his\r\nadversity as Governor of Nevada.\r\n\r\nOur room was on the lower floor, facing the plaza, and when we had got\r\nour bed, a small table, two chairs, the government fire-proof safe, and\r\nthe Unabridged Dictionary into it, there was still room enough left for a\r\nvisitor--may be two, but not without straining the walls.  But the walls\r\ncould stand it--at least the partitions could, for they consisted simply\r\nof one thickness of white "cotton domestic" stretched from corner to\r\ncorner of the room.  This was the rule in Carson--any other kind of\r\npartition was the rare exception.  And if you stood in a dark room and\r\nyour neighbors in the next had lights, the shadows on your canvas told\r\nqueer secrets sometimes!  Very often these partitions were made of old\r\nflour sacks basted together; and then the difference between the common\r\nherd and the aristocracy was, that the common herd had unornamented\r\nsacks, while the walls of the aristocrat were overpowering with\r\nrudimental fresco--i.e., red and blue mill brands on the flour sacks.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, also, the better classes embellished their canvas by\r\npasting pictures from Harper\'s Weekly on them.  In many cases, too, the\r\nwealthy and the cultured rose to spittoons and other evidences of a\r\nsumptuous and luxurious taste.  [Washoe people take a joke so hard that I\r\nmust explain that the above description was only the rule; there were\r\nmany honorable exceptions in Carson--plastered ceilings and houses that\r\nhad considerable furniture in them.--M. T.]\r\n\r\nWe had a carpet and a genuine queen\'s-ware washbowl.  Consequently we\r\nwere hated without reserve by the other tenants of the O\'Flannigan\r\n"ranch."  When we added a painted oilcloth window curtain, we simply took\r\nour lives into our own hands.  To prevent bloodshed I removed up stairs\r\nand took up quarters with the untitled plebeians in one of the fourteen\r\nwhite pine cot-bedsteads that stood in two long ranks in the one sole\r\nroom of which the second story consisted.\r\n\r\nIt was a jolly company, the fourteen.  They were principally voluntary\r\ncamp-followers of the Governor, who had joined his retinue by their own\r\nelection at New York and San Francisco and came along, feeling that in\r\nthe scuffle for little territorial crumbs and offices they could not make\r\ntheir condition more precarious than it was, and might reasonably expect\r\nto make it better.  They were popularly known as the "Irish Brigade,"\r\nthough there were only four or five Irishmen among all the Governor\'s\r\nretainers.\r\n\r\nHis good-natured Excellency was much annoyed at the gossip his henchmen\r\ncreated--especially when there arose a rumor that they were paid\r\nassassins of his, brought along to quietly reduce the democratic vote\r\nwhen desirable!\r\n\r\nMrs. O\'Flannigan was boarding and lodging them at ten dollars a week\r\napiece, and they were cheerfully giving their notes for it.  They were\r\nperfectly satisfied, but Bridget presently found that notes that could\r\nnot be discounted were but a feeble constitution for a Carson\r\nboarding-house.  So she began to harry the Governor to find employment\r\nfor the "Brigade."  Her importunities and theirs together drove him to a\r\ngentle desperation at last, and he finally summoned the Brigade to the\r\npresence. Then, said he:\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, I have planned a lucrative and useful service for you\r\n--a service which will provide you with recreation amid noble landscapes,\r\nand afford you never ceasing opportunities for enriching your minds by\r\nobservation and study.  I want you to survey a railroad from Carson City\r\nwestward to a certain point!  When the legislature meets I will have the\r\nnecessary bill passed and the remuneration arranged."\r\n\r\n"What, a railroad over the Sierra Nevada Mountains?"\r\n\r\n"Well, then, survey it eastward to a certain point!"\r\n\r\nHe converted them into surveyors, chain-bearers and so on, and turned\r\nthem loose in the desert.  It was "recreation" with a vengeance!\r\nRecreation on foot, lugging chains through sand and sage-brush, under a\r\nsultry sun and among cattle bones, cayotes and tarantulas.\r\n\r\n"Romantic adventure" could go no further.  They surveyed very slowly,\r\nvery deliberately, very carefully.  They returned every night during the\r\nfirst week, dusty, footsore, tired, and hungry, but very jolly.  They\r\nbrought in great store of prodigious hairy spiders--tarantulas--and\r\nimprisoned them in covered tumblers up stairs in the "ranch."  After the\r\nfirst week, they had to camp on the field, for they were getting well\r\neastward.  They made a good many inquiries as to the location of that\r\nindefinite "certain point," but got no information.  At last, to a\r\npeculiarly urgent inquiry of "How far eastward?"  Governor Nye\r\ntelegraphed back:\r\n\r\n"To the Atlantic Ocean, blast you!--and then bridge it and go on!"\r\n\r\nThis brought back the dusty toilers, who sent in a report and ceased from\r\ntheir labors.  The Governor was always comfortable about it; he said Mrs.\r\nO\'Flannigan would hold him for the Brigade\'s board anyhow, and he\r\nintended to get what entertainment he could out of the boys; he said,\r\nwith his old-time pleasant twinkle, that he meant to survey them into\r\nUtah and then telegraph Brigham to hang them for trespass!\r\n\r\nThe surveyors brought back more tarantulas with them, and so we had quite\r\na menagerie arranged along the shelves of the room.  Some of these\r\nspiders could straddle over a common saucer with their hairy, muscular\r\nlegs, and when their feelings were hurt, or their dignity offended, they\r\nwere the wickedest-looking desperadoes the animal world can furnish.\r\nIf their glass prison-houses were touched ever so lightly they were up\r\nand spoiling for a fight in a minute.  Starchy?--proud?  Indeed, they\r\nwould take up a straw and pick their teeth like a member of Congress.\r\nThere was as usual a furious "zephyr" blowing the first night of the\r\nbrigade\'s return, and about midnight the roof of an adjoining stable blew\r\noff, and a corner of it came crashing through the side of our ranch.\r\nThere was a simultaneous awakening, and a tumultuous muster of the\r\nbrigade in the dark, and a general tumbling and sprawling over each other\r\nin the narrow aisle between the bedrows.  In the midst of the turmoil,\r\nBob H---- sprung up out of a sound sleep, and knocked down a shelf with\r\nhis head.  Instantly he shouted:\r\n\r\n"Turn out, boys--the tarantulas is loose!"\r\n\r\nNo warning ever sounded so dreadful.  Nobody tried, any longer, to leave\r\nthe room, lest he might step on a tarantula.  Every man groped for a\r\ntrunk or a bed, and jumped on it.  Then followed the strangest silence--a\r\nsilence of grisly suspense it was, too--waiting, expectancy, fear.  It\r\nwas as dark as pitch, and one had to imagine the spectacle of those\r\nfourteen scant-clad men roosting gingerly on trunks and beds, for not a\r\nthing could be seen.  Then came occasional little interruptions of the\r\nsilence, and one could recognize a man and tell his locality by his\r\nvoice, or locate any other sound a sufferer made by his gropings or\r\nchanges of position.  The occasional voices were not given to much\r\nspeaking--you simply heard a gentle ejaculation of "Ow!" followed by a\r\nsolid thump, and you knew the gentleman had felt a hairy blanket or\r\nsomething touch his bare skin and had skipped from a bed to the floor.\r\nAnother silence.  Presently you would hear a gasping voice say:\r\n\r\n"Su--su--something\'s crawling up the back of my neck!"\r\n\r\nEvery now and then you could hear a little subdued scramble and a\r\nsorrowful "O Lord!" and then you knew that somebody was getting away from\r\nsomething he took for a tarantula, and not losing any time about it,\r\neither.  Directly a voice in the corner rang out wild and clear:\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got him!  I\'ve got him!" [Pause, and probable change of\r\ncircumstances.]  "No, he\'s got me!  Oh, ain\'t they never going to fetch a\r\nlantern!"\r\n\r\nThe lantern came at that moment, in the hands of Mrs. O\'Flannigan, whose\r\nanxiety to know the amount of damage done by the assaulting roof had not\r\nprevented her waiting a judicious interval, after getting out of bed and\r\nlighting up, to see if the wind was done, now, up stairs, or had a larger\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\nThe landscape presented when the lantern flashed into the room was\r\npicturesque, and might have been funny to some people, but was not to us.\r\nAlthough we were perched so strangely upon boxes, trunks and beds, and so\r\nstrangely attired, too, we were too earnestly distressed and too\r\ngenuinely miserable to see any fun about it, and there was not the\r\nsemblance of a smile anywhere visible.  I know I am not capable of\r\nsuffering more than I did during those few minutes of suspense in the\r\ndark, surrounded by those creeping, bloody-minded tarantulas.  I had\r\nskipped from bed to bed and from box to box in a cold agony, and every\r\ntime I touched anything that was furzy I fancied I felt the fangs.  I had\r\nrather go to war than live that episode over again.  Nobody was hurt.\r\nThe man who thought a tarantula had "got him" was mistaken--only a crack\r\nin a box had caught his finger.  Not one of those escaped tarantulas was\r\never seen again.  There were ten or twelve of them.  We took candles and\r\nhunted the place high and low for them, but with no success.  Did we go\r\nback to bed then?  We did nothing of the kind.  Money could not have\r\npersuaded us to do it.  We sat up the rest of the night playing cribbage\r\nand keeping a sharp lookout for the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nIt was the end of August, and the skies were cloudless and the weather\r\nsuperb.  In two or three weeks I had grown wonderfully fascinated with\r\nthe curious new country and concluded to put off my return to "the\r\nStates" awhile.  I had grown well accustomed to wearing a damaged slouch\r\nhat, blue woolen shirt, and pants crammed into boot-tops, and gloried in\r\nthe absence of coat, vest and braces.  I felt rowdyish and "bully," (as\r\nthe historian Josephus phrases it, in his fine chapter upon the\r\ndestruction of the Temple).  It seemed to me that nothing could be so\r\nfine and so romantic.  I had become an officer of the government, but\r\nthat was for mere sublimity.  The office was an unique sinecure.  I had\r\nnothing to do and no salary.  I was private Secretary to his majesty the\r\nSecretary and there was not yet writing enough for two of us.  So Johnny\r\nK---- and I devoted our time to amusement.  He was the young son of an\r\nOhio nabob and was out there for recreation.  He got it.  We had heard a\r\nworld of talk about the marvellous beauty of Lake Tahoe, and finally\r\ncuriosity drove us thither to see it.  Three or four members of the\r\nBrigade had been there and located some timber lands on its shores and\r\nstored up a quantity of provisions in their camp.  We strapped a couple\r\nof blankets on our shoulders and took an axe apiece and started--for we\r\nintended to take up a wood ranch or so ourselves and become wealthy.\r\nWe were on foot.  The reader will find it advantageous to go horseback.\r\nWe were told that the distance was eleven miles.  We tramped a long time\r\non level ground, and then toiled laboriously up a mountain about a\r\nthousand miles high and looked over.  No lake there.  We descended on the\r\nother side, crossed the valley and toiled up another mountain three or\r\nfour thousand miles high, apparently, and looked over again.  No lake\r\nyet.  We sat down tired and perspiring, and hired a couple of Chinamen to\r\ncurse those people who had beguiled us.  Thus refreshed, we presently\r\nresumed the march with renewed vigor and determination.  We plodded on,\r\ntwo or three hours longer, and at last the Lake burst upon us--a noble\r\nsheet of blue water lifted six thousand three hundred feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea, and walled in by a rim of snow-clad mountain peaks that\r\ntowered aloft full three thousand feet higher still!  It was a vast oval,\r\nand one would have to use up eighty or a hundred good miles in traveling\r\naround it.  As it lay there with the shadows of the mountains brilliantly\r\nphotographed upon its still surface I thought it must surely be the\r\nfairest picture the whole earth affords.\r\n\r\nWe found the small skiff belonging to the Brigade boys, and without loss\r\nof time set out across a deep bend of the lake toward the landmarks that\r\nsignified the locality of the camp.  I got Johnny to row--not because I\r\nmind exertion myself, but because it makes me sick to ride backwards when\r\nI am at work.  But I steered.  A three-mile pull brought us to the camp\r\njust as the night fell, and we stepped ashore very tired and wolfishly\r\nhungry.  In a "cache" among the rocks we found the provisions and the\r\ncooking utensils, and then, all fatigued as I was, I sat down on a\r\nboulder and superintended while Johnny gathered wood and cooked supper.\r\nMany a man who had gone through what I had, would have wanted to rest.\r\n\r\nIt was a delicious supper--hot bread, fried bacon, and black coffee.\r\nIt was a delicious solitude we were in, too.  Three miles away was a\r\nsaw-mill and some workmen, but there were not fifteen other human beings\r\nthroughout the wide circumference of the lake.  As the darkness closed\r\ndown and the stars came out and spangled the great mirror with jewels, we\r\nsmoked meditatively in the solemn hush and forgot our troubles and our\r\npains.  In due time we spread our blankets in the warm sand between two\r\nlarge boulders and soon feel asleep, careless of the procession of ants\r\nthat passed in through rents in our clothing and explored our persons.\r\nNothing could disturb the sleep that fettered us, for it had been fairly\r\nearned, and if our consciences had any sins on them they had to adjourn\r\ncourt for that night, any way.  The wind rose just as we were losing\r\nconsciousness, and we were lulled to sleep by the beating of the surf\r\nupon the shore.\r\n\r\nIt is always very cold on that lake shore in the night, but we had plenty\r\nof blankets and were warm enough.  We never moved a muscle all night, but\r\nwaked at early dawn in the original positions, and got up at once,\r\nthoroughly refreshed, free from soreness, and brim full of friskiness.\r\nThere is no end of wholesome medicine in such an experience.  That\r\nmorning we could have whipped ten such people as we were the day before\r\n--sick ones at any rate.  But the world is slow, and people will go to\r\n"water cures" and "movement cures" and to foreign lands for health.\r\nThree months of camp life on Lake Tahoe would restore an Egyptian mummy\r\nto his pristine vigor, and give him an appetite like an alligator.  I do\r\nnot mean the oldest and driest mummies, of course, but the fresher ones.\r\nThe air up there in the clouds is very pure and fine, bracing and\r\ndelicious.  And why shouldn\'t it be?--it is the same the angels breathe.\r\nI think that hardly any amount of fatigue can be gathered together that a\r\nman cannot sleep off in one night on the sand by its side.  Not under a\r\nroof, but under the sky; it seldom or never rains there in the summer\r\ntime.  I know a man who went there to die.  But he made a failure of it.\r\nHe was a skeleton when he came, and could barely stand.  He had no\r\nappetite, and did nothing but read tracts and reflect on the future.\r\nThree months later he was sleeping out of doors regularly, eating all he\r\ncould hold, three times a day, and chasing game over mountains three\r\nthousand feet high for recreation.  And he was a skeleton no longer, but\r\nweighed part of a ton.  This is no fancy sketch, but the truth.  His\r\ndisease was consumption.  I confidently commend his experience to other\r\nskeletons.\r\n\r\nI superintended again, and as soon as we had eaten breakfast we got in\r\nthe boat and skirted along the lake shore about three miles and\r\ndisembarked.  We liked the appearance of the place, and so we claimed\r\nsome three hundred acres of it and stuck our "notices" on a tree.  It was\r\nyellow pine timber land--a dense forest of trees a hundred feet high and\r\nfrom one to five feet through at the butt.  It was necessary to fence our\r\nproperty or we could not hold it.  That is to say, it was necessary to\r\ncut down trees here and there and make them fall in such a way as to form\r\na sort of enclosure (with pretty wide gaps in it).  We cut down three\r\ntrees apiece, and found it such heart-breaking work that we decided to\r\n"rest our case" on those; if they held the property, well and good; if\r\nthey didn\'t, let the property spill out through the gaps and go; it was\r\nno use to work ourselves to death merely to save a few acres of land.\r\nNext day we came back to build a house--for a house was also necessary,\r\nin order to hold the property.  We decided to build a substantial\r\nlog-house and excite the envy of the Brigade boys; but by the time we had\r\ncut and trimmed the first log it seemed unnecessary to be so elaborate,\r\nand so we concluded to build it of saplings.  However, two saplings, duly\r\ncut and trimmed, compelled recognition of the fact that a still modester\r\narchitecture would satisfy the law, and so we concluded to build a\r\n"brush" house.  We devoted the next day to this work, but we did so much\r\n"sitting around" and discussing, that by the middle of the afternoon we\r\nhad achieved only a half-way sort of affair which one of us had to watch\r\nwhile the other cut brush, lest if both turned our backs we might not be\r\nable to find it again, it had such a strong family resemblance to the\r\nsurrounding vegetation.  But we were satisfied with it.\r\n\r\nWe were land owners now, duly seized and possessed, and within the\r\nprotection of the law.  Therefore we decided to take up our residence on\r\nour own domain and enjoy that large sense of independence which only such\r\nan experience can bring.  Late the next afternoon, after a good long\r\nrest, we sailed away from the Brigade camp with all the provisions and\r\ncooking utensils we could carry off--borrow is the more accurate word\r\n--and just as the night was falling we beached the boat at our own landing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nIf there is any life that is happier than the life we led on our timber\r\nranch for the next two or three weeks, it must be a sort of life which I\r\nhave not read of in books or experienced in person.  We did not see a\r\nhuman being but ourselves during the time, or hear any sounds but those\r\nthat were made by the wind and the waves, the sighing of the pines, and\r\nnow and then the far-off thunder of an avalanche.  The forest about us\r\nwas dense and cool, the sky above us was cloudless and brilliant with\r\nsunshine, the broad lake before us was glassy and clear, or rippled and\r\nbreezy, or black and storm-tossed, according to Nature\'s mood; and its\r\ncircling border of mountain domes, clothed with forests, scarred with\r\nland-slides, cloven by canons and valleys, and helmeted with glittering\r\nsnow, fitly framed and finished the noble picture.  The view was always\r\nfascinating, bewitching, entrancing.  The eye was never tired of gazing,\r\nnight or day, in calm or storm; it suffered but one grief, and that was\r\nthat it could not look always, but must close sometimes in sleep.\r\n\r\nWe slept in the sand close to the water\'s edge, between two protecting\r\nboulders, which took care of the stormy night-winds for us.  We never\r\ntook any paregoric to make us sleep.  At the first break of dawn we were\r\nalways up and running foot-races to tone down excess of physical vigor\r\nand exuberance of spirits.  That is, Johnny was--but I held his hat.\r\nWhile smoking the pipe of peace after breakfast we watched the sentinel\r\npeaks put on the glory of the sun, and followed the conquering light as\r\nit swept down among the shadows, and set the captive crags and forests\r\nfree.  We watched the tinted pictures grow and brighten upon the water\r\ntill every little detail of forest, precipice and pinnacle was wrought in\r\nand finished, and the miracle of the enchanter complete.  Then to\r\n"business."\r\n\r\nThat is, drifting around in the boat.  We were on the north shore.\r\nThere, the rocks on the bottom are sometimes gray, sometimes white.\r\nThis gives the marvelous transparency of the water a fuller advantage\r\nthan it has elsewhere on the lake.  We usually pushed out a hundred yards\r\nor so from shore, and then lay down on the thwarts, in the sun, and let\r\nthe boat drift by the hour whither it would.  We seldom talked.\r\nIt interrupted the Sabbath stillness, and marred the dreams the luxurious\r\nrest and indolence brought.  The shore all along was indented with deep,\r\ncurved bays and coves, bordered by narrow sand-beaches; and where the\r\nsand ended, the steep mountain-sides rose right up aloft into space--rose\r\nup like a vast wall a little out of the perpendicular, and thickly wooded\r\nwith tall pines.\r\n\r\nSo singularly clear was the water, that where it was only twenty or\r\nthirty feet deep the bottom was so perfectly distinct that the boat\r\nseemed floating in the air!  Yes, where it was even eighty feet deep.\r\nEvery little pebble was distinct, every speckled trout, every\r\nhand\'s-breadth of sand.  Often, as we lay on our faces, a granite\r\nboulder, as large as a village church, would start out of the bottom\r\napparently, and seem climbing up rapidly to the surface, till presently\r\nit threatened to touch our faces, and we could not resist the impulse to\r\nseize an oar and avert the danger.  But the boat would float on, and the\r\nboulder descend again, and then we could see that when we had been\r\nexactly above it, it must still have been twenty or thirty feet below the\r\nsurface.  Down through the transparency of these great depths, the water\r\nwas not merely transparent, but dazzlingly, brilliantly so.  All objects\r\nseen through it had a bright, strong vividness, not only of outline, but\r\nof every minute detail, which they would not have had when seen simply\r\nthrough the same depth of atmosphere.  So empty and airy did all spaces\r\nseem below us, and so strong was the sense of floating high aloft in\r\nmid-nothingness, that we called these boat-excursions "balloon-voyages."\r\n\r\nWe fished a good deal, but we did not average one fish a week.  We could\r\nsee trout by the thousand winging about in the emptiness under us, or\r\nsleeping in shoals on the bottom, but they would not bite--they could see\r\nthe line too plainly, perhaps.  We frequently selected the trout we\r\nwanted, and rested the bait patiently and persistently on the end of his\r\nnose at a depth of eighty feet, but he would only shake it off with an\r\nannoyed manner, and shift his position.\r\n\r\nWe bathed occasionally, but the water was rather chilly, for all it\r\nlooked so sunny.  Sometimes we rowed out to the "blue water," a mile or\r\ntwo from shore.  It was as dead blue as indigo there, because of the\r\nimmense depth.  By official measurement the lake in its centre is one\r\nthousand five hundred and twenty-five feet deep!\r\n\r\nSometimes, on lazy afternoons, we lolled on the sand in camp, and smoked\r\npipes and read some old well-worn novels.  At night, by the camp-fire, we\r\nplayed euchre and seven-up to strengthen the mind--and played them with\r\ncards so greasy and defaced that only a whole summer\'s acquaintance with\r\nthem could enable the student to tell the ace of clubs from the jack of\r\ndiamonds.\r\n\r\nWe never slept in our "house."  It never recurred to us, for one thing;\r\nand besides, it was built to hold the ground, and that was enough.  We\r\ndid not wish to strain it.\r\n\r\nBy and by our provisions began to run short, and we went back to the old\r\ncamp and laid in a new supply.  We were gone all day, and reached home\r\nagain about night-fall, pretty tired and hungry.  While Johnny was\r\ncarrying the main bulk of the provisions up to our "house" for future\r\nuse, I took the loaf of bread, some slices of bacon, and the coffee-pot,\r\nashore, set them down by a tree, lit a fire, and went back to the boat to\r\nget the frying-pan.  While I was at this, I heard a shout from Johnny,\r\nand looking up I saw that my fire was galloping all over the premises!\r\nJohnny was on the other side of it.  He had to run through the flames to\r\nget to the lake shore, and then we stood helpless and watched the\r\ndevastation.\r\n\r\nThe ground was deeply carpeted with dry pine-needles, and the fire\r\ntouched them off as if they were gunpowder.  It was wonderful to see with\r\nwhat fierce speed the tall sheet of flame traveled!  My coffee-pot was\r\ngone, and everything with it.  In a minute and a half the fire seized\r\nupon a dense growth of dry manzanita chapparal six or eight feet high,\r\nand then the roaring and popping and crackling was something terrific.\r\nWe were driven to the boat by the intense heat, and there we remained,\r\nspell-bound.\r\n\r\nWithin half an hour all before us was a tossing, blinding tempest of\r\nflame!  It went surging up adjacent ridges--surmounted them and\r\ndisappeared in the canons beyond--burst into view upon higher and farther\r\nridges, presently--shed a grander illumination abroad, and dove again\r\n--flamed out again, directly, higher and still higher up the\r\nmountain-side--threw out skirmishing parties of fire here and there, and\r\nsent them trailing their crimson spirals away among remote ramparts and\r\nribs and gorges, till as far as the eye could reach the lofty\r\nmountain-fronts were webbed as it were with a tangled network of red lava\r\nstreams. Away across the water the crags and domes were lit with a ruddy\r\nglare, and the firmament above was a reflected hell!\r\n\r\nEvery feature of the spectacle was repeated in the glowing mirror of the\r\nlake!  Both pictures were sublime, both were beautiful; but that in the\r\nlake had a bewildering richness about it that enchanted the eye and held\r\nit with the stronger fascination.\r\n\r\nWe sat absorbed and motionless through four long hours.  We never thought\r\nof supper, and never felt fatigue.  But at eleven o\'clock the\r\nconflagration had traveled beyond our range of vision, and then darkness\r\nstole down upon the landscape again.\r\n\r\nHunger asserted itself now, but there was nothing to eat.  The provisions\r\nwere all cooked, no doubt, but we did not go to see.  We were homeless\r\nwanderers again, without any property.  Our fence was gone, our house\r\nburned down; no insurance.  Our pine forest was well scorched, the dead\r\ntrees all burned up, and our broad acres of manzanita swept away.  Our\r\nblankets were on our usual sand-bed, however, and so we lay down and went\r\nto sleep.  The next morning we started back to the old camp, but while\r\nout a long way from shore, so great a storm came up that we dared not try\r\nto land.  So I baled out the seas we shipped, and Johnny pulled heavily\r\nthrough the billows till we had reached a point three or four miles\r\nbeyond the camp.  The storm was increasing, and it became evident that it\r\nwas better to take the hazard of beaching the boat than go down in a\r\nhundred fathoms of water; so we ran in, with tall white-caps following,\r\nand I sat down in the stern-sheets and pointed her head-on to the shore.\r\nThe instant the bow struck, a wave came over the stern that washed crew\r\nand cargo ashore, and saved a deal of trouble.  We shivered in the lee of\r\na boulder all the rest of the day, and froze all the night through.  In\r\nthe morning the tempest had gone down, and we paddled down to the camp\r\nwithout any unnecessary delay.  We were so starved that we ate up the\r\nrest of the Brigade\'s provisions, and then set out to Carson to tell them\r\nabout it and ask their forgiveness.  It was accorded, upon payment of\r\ndamages.\r\n\r\nWe made many trips to the lake after that, and had many a hair-breadth\r\nescape and blood-curdling adventure which will never be recorded in any\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nI resolved to have a horse to ride.  I had never seen such wild, free,\r\nmagnificent horsemanship outside of a circus as these picturesquely-clad\r\nMexicans, Californians and Mexicanized Americans displayed in Carson\r\nstreets every day.  How they rode!  Leaning just gently forward out of\r\nthe perpendicular, easy and nonchalant, with broad slouch-hat brim blown\r\nsquare up in front, and long riata swinging above the head, they swept\r\nthrough the town like the wind!  The next minute they were only a sailing\r\npuff of dust on the far desert.  If they trotted, they sat up gallantly\r\nand gracefully, and seemed part of the horse; did not go jiggering up and\r\ndown after the silly Miss-Nancy fashion of the riding-schools.  I had\r\nquickly learned to tell a horse from a cow, and was full of anxiety to\r\nlearn more.  I was resolved to buy a horse.\r\n\r\nWhile the thought was rankling in my mind, the auctioneer came skurrying\r\nthrough the plaza on a black beast that had as many humps and corners on\r\nhim as a dromedary, and was necessarily uncomely; but he was "going,\r\ngoing, at twenty-two!--horse, saddle and bridle at twenty-two dollars,\r\ngentlemen!" and I could hardly resist.\r\n\r\nA man whom I did not know (he turned out to be the auctioneer\'s brother)\r\nnoticed the wistful look in my eye, and observed that that was a very\r\nremarkable horse to be going at such a price; and added that the saddle\r\nalone was worth the money.  It was a Spanish saddle, with ponderous\r\n\'tapidaros\', and furnished with the ungainly sole-leather covering with\r\nthe unspellable name.  I said I had half a notion to bid.  Then this\r\nkeen-eyed person appeared to me to be "taking my measure"; but I\r\ndismissed the suspicion when he spoke, for his manner was full of\r\nguileless candor and truthfulness.  Said he:\r\n\r\n"I know that horse--know him well.  You are a stranger, I take it, and so\r\nyou might think he was an American horse, maybe, but I assure you he is\r\nnot.  He is nothing of the kind; but--excuse my speaking in a low voice,\r\nother people being near--he is, without the shadow of a doubt, a Genuine\r\nMexican Plug!"\r\n\r\nI did not know what a Genuine Mexican Plug was, but there was something\r\nabout this man\'s way of saying it, that made me swear inwardly that I\r\nwould own a Genuine Mexican Plug, or die.\r\n\r\n"Has he any other--er--advantages?"  I inquired, suppressing what\r\neagerness I could.\r\n\r\nHe hooked his forefinger in the pocket of my army-shirt, led me to one\r\nside, and breathed in my ear impressively these words:\r\n\r\n"He can out-buck anything in America!"\r\n\r\n"Going, going, going--at twent--ty--four dollars and a half, gen--"\r\n\r\n"Twenty-seven!" I shouted, in a frenzy.\r\n\r\n"And sold!" said the auctioneer, and passed over the Genuine Mexican Plug\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nI could scarcely contain my exultation.  I paid the money, and put the\r\nanimal in a neighboring livery-stable to dine and rest himself.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I brought the creature into the plaza, and certain\r\ncitizens held him by the head, and others by the tail, while I mounted\r\nhim.  As soon as they let go, he placed all his feet in a bunch together,\r\nlowered his back, and then suddenly arched it upward, and shot me\r\nstraight into the air a matter of three or four feet!  I came as straight\r\ndown again, lit in the saddle, went instantly up again, came down almost\r\non the high pommel, shot up again, and came down on the horse\'s neck--all\r\nin the space of three or four seconds.  Then he rose and stood almost\r\nstraight up on his hind feet, and I, clasping his lean neck desperately,\r\nslid back into the saddle and held on.  He came down, and immediately\r\nhoisted his heels into the air, delivering a vicious kick at the sky, and\r\nstood on his forefeet.  And then down he came once more, and began the\r\noriginal exercise of shooting me straight up again.  The third time I\r\nwent up I heard a stranger say:\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t he buck, though!"\r\n\r\nWhile I was up, somebody struck the horse a sounding thwack with a\r\nleathern strap, and when I arrived again the Genuine Mexican Plug was not\r\nthere.  A California youth chased him up and caught him, and asked if he\r\nmight have a ride.  I granted him that luxury.  He mounted the Genuine,\r\ngot lifted into the air once, but sent his spurs home as he descended,\r\nand the horse darted away like a telegram.  He soared over three fences\r\nlike a bird, and disappeared down the road toward the Washoe Valley.\r\n\r\nI sat down on a stone, with a sigh, and by a natural impulse one of my\r\nhands sought my forehead, and the other the base of my stomach.  I\r\nbelieve I never appreciated, till then, the poverty of the human\r\nmachinery--for I still needed a hand or two to place elsewhere.  Pen\r\ncannot describe how I was jolted up.  Imagination cannot conceive how\r\ndisjointed I was--how internally, externally and universally I was\r\nunsettled, mixed up and ruptured.  There was a sympathetic crowd around\r\nme, though.\r\n\r\nOne elderly-looking comforter said:\r\n\r\n"Stranger, you\'ve been taken in.  Everybody in this camp knows that\r\nhorse.  Any child, any Injun, could have told you that he\'d buck; he is\r\nthe very worst devil to buck on the continent of America.  You hear me.\r\nI\'m Curry.  Old Curry.  Old Abe Curry.  And moreover, he is a simon-pure,\r\nout-and-out, genuine d--d Mexican plug, and an uncommon mean one at that,\r\ntoo.  Why, you turnip, if you had laid low and kept dark, there\'s chances\r\nto buy an American horse for mighty little more than you paid for that\r\nbloody old foreign relic."\r\n\r\nI gave no sign; but I made up my mind that if the auctioneer\'s brother\'s\r\nfuneral took place while I was in the Territory I would postpone all\r\nother recreations and attend it.\r\n\r\nAfter a gallop of sixteen miles the Californian youth and the Genuine\r\nMexican Plug came tearing into town again, shedding foam-flakes like the\r\nspume-spray that drives before a typhoon, and, with one final skip over a\r\nwheelbarrow and a Chinaman, cast anchor in front of the "ranch."\r\n\r\nSuch panting and blowing!  Such spreading and contracting of the red\r\nequine nostrils, and glaring of the wild equine eye!  But was the\r\nimperial beast subjugated?  Indeed he was not.\r\n\r\nHis lordship the Speaker of the House thought he was, and mounted him to\r\ngo down to the Capitol; but the first dash the creature made was over a\r\npile of telegraph poles half as high as a church; and his time to the\r\nCapitol--one mile and three quarters--remains unbeaten to this day.  But\r\nthen he took an advantage--he left out the mile, and only did the three\r\nquarters.  That is to say, he made a straight cut across lots, preferring\r\nfences and ditches to a crooked road; and when the Speaker got to the\r\nCapitol he said he had been in the air so much he felt as if he had made\r\nthe trip on a comet.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the Speaker came home afoot for exercise, and got the\r\nGenuine towed back behind a quartz wagon.  The next day I loaned the\r\nanimal to the Clerk of the House to go down to the Dana silver mine, six\r\nmiles, and he walked back for exercise, and got the horse towed.\r\nEverybody I loaned him to always walked back; they never could get enough\r\nexercise any other way.\r\n\r\nStill, I continued to loan him to anybody who was willing to borrow him,\r\nmy idea being to get him crippled, and throw him on the borrower\'s hands,\r\nor killed, and make the borrower pay for him.  But somehow nothing ever\r\nhappened to him.  He took chances that no other horse ever took and\r\nsurvived, but he always came out safe.  It was his daily habit to try\r\nexperiments that had always before been considered impossible, but he\r\nalways got through.  Sometimes he miscalculated a little, and did not get\r\nhis rider through intact, but he always got through himself.  Of course I\r\nhad tried to sell him; but that was a stretch of simplicity which met\r\nwith little sympathy.  The auctioneer stormed up and down the streets on\r\nhim for four days, dispersing the populace, interrupting business, and\r\ndestroying children, and never got a bid--at least never any but the\r\neighteen-dollar one he hired a notoriously substanceless bummer to make.\r\nThe people only smiled pleasantly, and restrained their desire to buy, if\r\nthey had any.  Then the auctioneer brought in his bill, and I withdrew\r\nthe horse from the market.  We tried to trade him off at private vendue\r\nnext, offering him at a sacrifice for second-hand tombstones, old iron,\r\ntemperance tracts--any kind of property.  But holders were stiff, and we\r\nretired from the market again.  I never tried to ride the horse any more.\r\nWalking was good enough exercise for a man like me, that had nothing the\r\nmatter with him except ruptures, internal injuries, and such things.\r\nFinally I tried to give him away.  But it was a failure.  Parties said\r\nearthquakes were handy enough on the Pacific coast--they did not wish to\r\nown one.  As a last resort I offered him to the Governor for the use of\r\nthe "Brigade."  His face lit up eagerly at first, but toned down again,\r\nand he said the thing would be too palpable.\r\n\r\nJust then the livery stable man brought in his bill for six weeks\'\r\nkeeping--stall-room for the horse, fifteen dollars; hay for the horse,\r\ntwo hundred and fifty!  The Genuine Mexican Plug had eaten a ton of the\r\narticle, and the man said he would have eaten a hundred if he had let\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI will remark here, in all seriousness, that the regular price of hay\r\nduring that year and a part of the next was really two hundred and fifty\r\ndollars a ton.  During a part of the previous year it had sold at five\r\nhundred a ton, in gold, and during the winter before that there was such\r\nscarcity of the article that in several instances small quantities had\r\nbrought eight hundred dollars a ton in coin!  The consequence might be\r\nguessed without my telling it: peopled turned their stock loose to\r\nstarve, and before the spring arrived Carson and Eagle valleys were\r\nalmost literally carpeted with their carcases!  Any old settler there\r\nwill verify these statements.\r\n\r\nI managed to pay the livery bill, and that same day I gave the Genuine\r\nMexican Plug to a passing Arkansas emigrant whom fortune delivered into\r\nmy hand.  If this ever meets his eye, he will doubtless remember the\r\ndonation.\r\n\r\nNow whoever has had the luck to ride a real Mexican plug will recognize\r\nthe animal depicted in this chapter, and hardly consider him exaggerated\r\n--but the uninitiated will feel justified in regarding his portrait as a\r\nfancy sketch, perhaps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nOriginally, Nevada was a part of Utah and was called Carson county; and a\r\npretty large county it was, too.  Certain of its valleys produced no end\r\nof hay, and this attracted small colonies of Mormon stock-raisers and\r\nfarmers to them.  A few orthodox Americans straggled in from California,\r\nbut no love was lost between the two classes of colonists.  There was\r\nlittle or no friendly intercourse; each party staid to itself.  The\r\nMormons were largely in the majority, and had the additional advantage of\r\nbeing peculiarly under the protection of the Mormon government of the\r\nTerritory.  Therefore they could afford to be distant, and even\r\nperemptory toward their neighbors.  One of the traditions of Carson\r\nValley illustrates the condition of things that prevailed at the time I\r\nspeak of.  The hired girl of one of the American families was Irish, and\r\na Catholic; yet it was noted with surprise that she was the only person\r\noutside of the Mormon ring who could get favors from the Mormons.  She\r\nasked kindnesses of them often, and always got them.  It was a mystery to\r\neverybody.  But one day as she was passing out at the door, a large bowie\r\nknife dropped from under her apron, and when her mistress asked for an\r\nexplanation she observed that she was going out to "borry a wash-tub from\r\nthe Mormons!"\r\n\r\nIn 1858 silver lodes were discovered in "Carson County," and then the\r\naspect of things changed.  Californians began to flock in, and the\r\nAmerican element was soon in the majority.  Allegiance to Brigham Young\r\nand Utah was renounced, and a temporary territorial government for\r\n"Washoe" was instituted by the citizens.  Governor Roop was the first and\r\nonly chief magistrate of it.  In due course of time Congress passed a\r\nbill to organize "Nevada Territory," and President Lincoln sent out\r\nGovernor Nye to supplant Roop.\r\n\r\nAt this time the population of the Territory was about twelve or fifteen\r\nthousand, and rapidly increasing.  Silver mines were being vigorously\r\ndeveloped and silver mills erected.  Business of all kinds was active and\r\nprosperous and growing more so day by day.\r\n\r\nThe people were glad to have a legitimately constituted government, but\r\ndid not particularly enjoy having strangers from distant States put in\r\nauthority over them--a sentiment that was natural enough.  They thought\r\nthe officials should have been chosen from among themselves from among\r\nprominent citizens who had earned a right to such promotion, and who\r\nwould be in sympathy with the populace and likewise thoroughly acquainted\r\nwith the needs of the Territory.  They were right in viewing the matter\r\nthus, without doubt.  The new officers were "emigrants," and that was no\r\ntitle to anybody\'s affection or admiration either.\r\n\r\nThe new government was received with considerable coolness.  It was not\r\nonly a foreign intruder, but a poor one.  It was not even worth plucking\r\n--except by the smallest of small fry office-seekers and such.  Everybody\r\nknew that Congress had appropriated only twenty thousand dollars a year\r\nin greenbacks for its support--about money enough to run a quartz mill a\r\nmonth.  And everybody knew, also, that the first year\'s money was still\r\nin Washington, and that the getting hold of it would be a tedious and\r\ndifficult process.  Carson City was too wary and too wise to open up a\r\ncredit account with the imported bantling with anything like indecent\r\nhaste.\r\n\r\nThere is something solemnly funny about the struggles of a new-born\r\nTerritorial government to get a start in this world.  Ours had a trying\r\ntime of it.  The Organic Act and the "instructions" from the State\r\nDepartment commanded that a legislature should be elected at\r\nsuch-and-such a time, and its sittings inaugurated at such-and-such a\r\ndate.  It was easy to get legislators, even at three dollars a day,\r\nalthough board was four dollars and fifty cents, for distinction has its\r\ncharm in Nevada as well as elsewhere, and there were plenty of patriotic\r\nsouls out of employment; but to get a legislative hall for them to meet\r\nin was another matter altogether.  Carson blandly declined to give a room\r\nrent-free, or let one to the government on credit.\r\n\r\nBut when Curry heard of the difficulty, he came forward, solitary and\r\nalone, and shouldered the Ship of State over the bar and got her afloat\r\nagain.  I refer to "Curry--Old Curry--Old Abe Curry."  But for him the\r\nlegislature would have been obliged to sit in the desert.  He offered his\r\nlarge stone building just outside the capital limits, rent-free, and it\r\nwas gladly accepted.  Then he built a horse-railroad from town to the\r\ncapitol, and carried the legislators gratis.\r\n\r\nHe also furnished pine benches and chairs for the legislature, and\r\ncovered the floors with clean saw-dust by way of carpet and spittoon\r\ncombined.  But for Curry the government would have died in its tender\r\ninfancy.  A canvas partition to separate the Senate from the House of\r\nRepresentatives was put up by the Secretary, at a cost of three dollars\r\nand forty cents, but the United States declined to pay for it.  Upon\r\nbeing reminded that the "instructions" permitted the payment of a liberal\r\nrent for a legislative hall, and that that money was saved to the country\r\nby Mr. Curry\'s generosity, the United States said that did not alter the\r\nmatter, and the three dollars and forty cents would be subtracted from\r\nthe Secretary\'s eighteen hundred dollar salary--and it was!\r\n\r\nThe matter of printing was from the beginning an interesting feature of\r\nthe new government\'s difficulties.  The Secretary was sworn to obey his\r\nvolume of written "instructions," and these commanded him to do two\r\ncertain things without fail, viz.:\r\n\r\n1.  Get the House and Senate journals printed; and,\r\n2.  For this work, pay one dollar and fifty cents per "thousand" for\r\ncomposition, and one dollar and fifty cents per "token" for press-work,\r\nin greenbacks.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to swear to do these two things, but it was entirely\r\nimpossible to do more than one of them.  When greenbacks had gone down to\r\nforty cents on the dollar, the prices regularly charged everybody by\r\nprinting establishments were one dollar and fifty cents per "thousand"\r\nand one dollar and fifty cents per "token," in gold.  The "instructions"\r\ncommanded that the Secretary regard a paper dollar issued by the\r\ngovernment as equal to any other dollar issued by the government.  Hence\r\nthe printing of the journals was discontinued.  Then the United States\r\nsternly rebuked the Secretary for disregarding the "instructions," and\r\nwarned him to correct his ways.  Wherefore he got some printing done,\r\nforwarded the bill to Washington with full exhibits of the high prices of\r\nthings in the Territory, and called attention to a printed market report\r\nwherein it would be observed that even hay was two hundred and fifty\r\ndollars a ton.  The United States responded by subtracting the\r\nprinting-bill from the Secretary\'s suffering salary--and moreover\r\nremarked with dense gravity that he would find nothing in his\r\n"instructions" requiring him to purchase hay!\r\n\r\nNothing in this world is palled in such impenetrable obscurity as a U.S.\r\nTreasury Comptroller\'s understanding.  The very fires of the hereafter\r\ncould get up nothing more than a fitful glimmer in it.  In the days I\r\nspeak of he never could be made to comprehend why it was that twenty\r\nthousand dollars would not go as far in Nevada, where all commodities\r\nranged at an enormous figure, as it would in the other Territories, where\r\nexceeding cheapness was the rule.  He was an officer who looked out for\r\nthe little expenses all the time.  The Secretary of the Territory kept\r\nhis office in his bedroom, as I before remarked; and he charged the\r\nUnited States no rent, although his "instructions" provided for that item\r\nand he could have justly taken advantage of it (a thing which I would\r\nhave done with more than lightning promptness if I had been Secretary\r\nmyself).  But the United States never applauded this devotion.  Indeed, I\r\nthink my country was ashamed to have so improvident a person in its\r\nemploy.\r\n\r\nThose "instructions" (we used to read a chapter from them every morning,\r\nas intellectual gymnastics, and a couple of chapters in Sunday school\r\nevery Sabbath, for they treated of all subjects under the sun and had\r\nmuch valuable religious matter in them along with the other statistics)\r\nthose "instructions" commanded that pen-knives, envelopes, pens and\r\nwriting-paper be furnished the members of the legislature.  So the\r\nSecretary made the purchase and the distribution.  The knives cost three\r\ndollars apiece.  There was one too many, and the Secretary gave it to the\r\nClerk of the House of Representatives.  The United States said the Clerk\r\nof the House was not a "member" of the legislature, and took that three\r\ndollars out of the Secretary\'s salary, as usual.\r\n\r\nWhite men charged three or four dollars a "load" for sawing up\r\nstove-wood.  The Secretary was sagacious enough to know that the United\r\nStates would never pay any such price as that; so he got an Indian to saw\r\nup a load of office wood at one dollar and a half.  He made out the usual\r\nvoucher, but signed no name to it--simply appended a note explaining that\r\nan Indian had done the work, and had done it in a very capable and\r\nsatisfactory way, but could not sign the voucher owing to lack of ability\r\nin the necessary direction.  The Secretary had to pay that dollar and a\r\nhalf.  He thought the United States would admire both his economy and his\r\nhonesty in getting the work done at half price and not putting a\r\npretended Indian\'s signature to the voucher, but the United States did\r\nnot see it in that light.\r\n\r\nThe United States was too much accustomed to employing dollar-and-a-half\r\nthieves in all manner of official capacities to regard his explanation of\r\nthe voucher as having any foundation in fact.\r\n\r\nBut the next time the Indian sawed wood for us I taught him to make a\r\ncross at the bottom of the voucher--it looked like a cross that had been\r\ndrunk a year--and then I "witnessed" it and it went through all right.\r\nThe United States never said a word.  I was sorry I had not made the\r\nvoucher for a thousand loads of wood instead of one.\r\n\r\nThe government of my country snubs honest simplicity but fondles artistic\r\nvillainy, and I think I might have developed into a very capable\r\npickpocket if I had remained in the public service a year or two.\r\n\r\nThat was a fine collection of sovereigns, that first Nevada legislature.\r\nThey levied taxes to the amount of thirty or forty thousand dollars and\r\nordered expenditures to the extent of about a million.  Yet they had\r\ntheir little periodical explosions of economy like all other bodies of\r\nthe kind.  A member proposed to save three dollars a day to the nation by\r\ndispensing with the Chaplain.  And yet that short-sighted man needed the\r\nChaplain more than any other member, perhaps, for he generally sat with\r\nhis feet on his desk, eating raw turnips, during the morning prayer.\r\n\r\nThe legislature sat sixty days, and passed private tollroad franchises\r\nall the time.  When they adjourned it was estimated that every citizen\r\nowned about three franchises, and it was believed that unless Congress\r\ngave the Territory another degree of longitude there would not be room\r\nenough to accommodate the toll-roads.  The ends of them were hanging over\r\nthe boundary line everywhere like a fringe.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, the freighting business had grown to such important\r\nproportions that there was nearly as much excitement over suddenly\r\nacquired toll-road fortunes as over the wonderful silver mines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nBy and by I was smitten with the silver fever.  "Prospecting parties"\r\nwere leaving for the mountains every day, and discovering and taking\r\npossession of rich silver-bearing lodes and ledges of quartz.  Plainly\r\nthis was the road to fortune.  The great "Gould and Curry" mine was held\r\nat three or four hundred dollars a foot when we arrived; but in two\r\nmonths it had sprung up to eight hundred.  The "Ophir" had been worth\r\nonly a mere trifle, a year gone by, and now it was selling at nearly four\r\nthousand dollars a foot!  Not a mine could be named that had not\r\nexperienced an astonishing advance in value within a short time.\r\nEverybody was talking about these marvels.  Go where you would, you heard\r\nnothing else, from morning till far into the night.  Tom So-and-So had\r\nsold out of the "Amanda Smith" for $40,000--hadn\'t a cent when he "took\r\nup" the ledge six months ago.  John Jones had sold half his interest in\r\nthe "Bald Eagle and Mary Ann" for $65,000, gold coin, and gone to the\r\nStates for his family.  The widow Brewster had "struck it rich" in the\r\n"Golden Fleece" and sold ten feet for $18,000--hadn\'t money enough to buy\r\na crape bonnet when Sing-Sing Tommy killed her husband at Baldy Johnson\'s\r\nwake last spring.  The "Last Chance" had found a "clay casing" and knew\r\nthey were "right on the ledge"--consequence, "feet" that went begging\r\nyesterday were worth a brick house apiece to-day, and seedy owners who\r\ncould not get trusted for a drink at any bar in the country yesterday\r\nwere roaring drunk on champagne to-day and had hosts of warm personal\r\nfriends in a town where they had forgotten how to bow or shake hands from\r\nlong-continued want of practice.  Johnny Morgan, a common loafer, had\r\ngone to sleep in the gutter and waked up worth a hundred thousand\r\ndollars, in consequence of the decision in the "Lady Franklin and Rough\r\nand Ready" lawsuit.  And so on--day in and day out the talk pelted our\r\nears and the excitement waxed hotter and hotter around us.\r\n\r\nI would have been more or less than human if I had not gone mad like the\r\nrest.  Cart-loads of solid silver bricks, as large as pigs of lead, were\r\narriving from the mills every day, and such sights as that gave substance\r\nto the wild talk about me.  I succumbed and grew as frenzied as the\r\ncraziest.\r\n\r\nEvery few days news would come of the discovery of a bran-new mining\r\nregion; immediately the papers would teem with accounts of its richness,\r\nand away the surplus population would scamper to take possession.  By the\r\ntime I was fairly inoculated with the disease, "Esmeralda" had just had a\r\nrun and "Humboldt" was beginning to shriek for attention.  "Humboldt!\r\nHumboldt!" was the new cry, and straightway Humboldt, the newest of the\r\nnew, the richest of the rich, the most marvellous of the marvellous\r\ndiscoveries in silver-land was occupying two columns of the public prints\r\nto "Esmeralda\'s" one.  I was just on the point of starting to Esmeralda,\r\nbut turned with the tide and got ready for Humboldt.  That the reader may\r\nsee what moved me, and what would as surely have moved him had he been\r\nthere, I insert here one of the newspaper letters of the day.  It and\r\nseveral other letters from the same calm hand were the main means of\r\nconverting me.  I shall not garble the extract, but put it in just as it\r\nappeared in the Daily Territorial Enterprise:\r\n\r\n      But what about our mines?  I shall be candid with you.  I shall\r\n      express an honest opinion, based upon a thorough examination.\r\n      Humboldt county is the richest mineral region upon God\'s footstool.\r\n      Each mountain range is gorged with the precious ores.  Humboldt is\r\n      the true Golconda.\r\n\r\n      The other day an assay of mere croppings yielded exceeding four\r\n      thousand dollars to the ton.  A week or two ago an assay of just\r\n      such surface developments made returns of seven thousand dollars to\r\n      the ton.  Our mountains are full of rambling prospectors.  Each day\r\n      and almost every hour reveals new and more startling evidences of\r\n      the profuse and intensified wealth of our favored county.  The metal\r\n      is not silver alone.  There are distinct ledges of auriferous ore.\r\n      A late discovery plainly evinces cinnabar.  The coarser metals are\r\n      in gross abundance.  Lately evidences of bituminous coal have been\r\n      detected.  My theory has ever been that coal is a ligneous\r\n      formation.  I told Col.  Whitman, in times past, that the\r\n      neighborhood of Dayton (Nevada) betrayed no present or previous\r\n      manifestations of a ligneous foundation, and that hence I had no\r\n      confidence in his lauded coal mines.  I repeated the same doctrine\r\n      to the exultant coal discoverers of Humboldt.  I talked with my\r\n      friend Captain Burch on the subject.  My pyrhanism vanished upon his\r\n      statement that in the very region referred to he had seen petrified\r\n      trees of the length of two hundred feet.  Then is the fact\r\n      established that huge forests once cast their grim shadows over this\r\n      remote section.  I am firm in the coal faith.\r\n\r\n      Have no fears of the mineral resources of Humboldt county.  They are\r\n      immense--incalculable.\r\n\r\nLet me state one or two things which will help the reader to better\r\ncomprehend certain items in the above.  At this time, our near neighbor,\r\nGold Hill, was the most successful silver mining locality in Nevada.  It\r\nwas from there that more than half the daily shipments of silver bricks\r\ncame.  "Very rich" (and scarce) Gold Hill ore yielded from $100 to $400\r\nto the ton; but the usual yield was only $20 to $40 per ton--that is to\r\nsay, each hundred pounds of ore yielded from one dollar to two dollars.\r\nBut the reader will perceive by the above extract, that in Humboldt from\r\none fourth to nearly half the mass was silver!  That is to say, every one\r\nhundred pounds of the ore had from two hundred dollars up to about three\r\nhundred and fifty in it.  Some days later this same correspondent wrote:\r\n\r\n      I have spoken of the vast and almost fabulous wealth of this\r\n      region--it is incredible.  The intestines of our mountains are\r\n      gorged with precious ore to plethora.  I have said that nature\r\n      has so shaped our mountains as to furnish most excellent\r\n      facilities for the working of our mines.  I have also told you\r\n      that the country about here is pregnant with the finest mill\r\n      sites in the world.  But what is the mining history of Humboldt?\r\n      The Sheba mine is in the hands of energetic San Francisco\r\n      capitalists.  It would seem that the ore is combined with metals\r\n      that render it difficult of reduction with our imperfect mountain\r\n      machinery.  The proprietors have combined the capital and labor\r\n      hinted at in my exordium.  They are toiling and probing.  Their\r\n      tunnel has reached the length of one hundred feet.  From primal\r\n      assays alone, coupled with the development of the mine and public\r\n      confidence in the continuance of effort, the stock had reared\r\n      itself to eight hundred dollars market value.  I do not know that\r\n      one ton of the ore has been converted into current metal.  I do\r\n      know that there are many lodes in this section that surpass the\r\n      Sheba in primal assay value.  Listen a moment to the calculations\r\n      of the Sheba operators.  They purpose transporting the ore\r\n      concentrated to Europe.  The conveyance from Star City (its\r\n      locality) to Virginia City will cost seventy dollars per ton;\r\n      from Virginia to San Francisco, forty dollars per ton; from\r\n      thence to Liverpool, its destination, ten dollars per ton.  Their\r\n      idea is that its conglomerate metals will reimburse them their\r\n      cost of original extraction, the price of transportation, and the\r\n      expense of reduction, and that then a ton of the raw ore will net\r\n      them twelve hundred dollars.  The estimate may be extravagant.\r\n      Cut it in twain, and the product is enormous, far transcending\r\n      any previous developments of our racy Territory.\r\n\r\n      A very common calculation is that many of our mines will yield\r\n      five hundred dollars to the ton.  Such fecundity throws the Gould\r\n      & Curry, the Ophir and the Mexican, of your neighborhood, in the\r\n      darkest shadow.  I have given you the estimate of the value of a\r\n      single developed mine.  Its richness is indexed by its market\r\n      valuation.  The people of Humboldt county are feet crazy.  As I\r\n      write, our towns are near deserted.  They look as languid as a\r\n      consumptive girl.  What has become of our sinewy and athletic\r\n      fellow-citizens?  They are coursing through ravines and over\r\n      mountain tops.  Their tracks are visible in every direction.\r\n      Occasionally a horseman will dash among us.  His steed betrays\r\n      hard usage.  He alights before his adobe dwelling, hastily\r\n      exchanges courtesies with his townsmen, hurries to an assay\r\n      office and from thence to the District Recorder\'s.  In the\r\n      morning, having renewed his provisional supplies, he is off again\r\n      on his wild and unbeaten route.  Why, the fellow numbers already\r\n      his feet by the thousands.  He is the horse-leech.  He has the\r\n      craving stomach of the shark or anaconda.  He would conquer\r\n      metallic worlds.\r\n\r\nThis was enough.  The instant we had finished reading the above article,\r\nfour of us decided to go to Humboldt.  We commenced getting ready at\r\nonce.  And we also commenced upbraiding ourselves for not deciding\r\nsooner--for we were in terror lest all the rich mines would be found and\r\nsecured before we got there, and we might have to put up with ledges that\r\nwould not yield more than two or three hundred dollars a ton, maybe.  An\r\nhour before, I would have felt opulent if I had owned ten feet in a Gold\r\nHill mine whose ore produced twenty-five dollars to the ton; now I was\r\nalready annoyed at the prospect of having to put up with mines the\r\npoorest of which would be a marvel in Gold Hill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nHurry, was the word!  We wasted no time.  Our party consisted of four\r\npersons--a blacksmith sixty years of age, two young lawyers, and myself.\r\nWe bought a wagon and two miserable old horses.  We put eighteen hundred\r\npounds of provisions and mining tools in the wagon and drove out of\r\nCarson on a chilly December afternoon.  The horses were so weak and old\r\nthat we soon found that it would be better if one or two of us got out\r\nand walked.  It was an improvement.  Next, we found that it would be\r\nbetter if a third man got out.  That was an improvement also.  It was at\r\nthis time that I volunteered to drive, although I had never driven a\r\nharnessed horse before and many a man in such a position would have felt\r\nfairly excused from such a responsibility.  But in a little while it was\r\nfound that it would be a fine thing if the drive got out and walked also.\r\nIt was at this time that I resigned the position of driver, and never\r\nresumed it again.  Within the hour, we found that it would not only be\r\nbetter, but was absolutely necessary, that we four, taking turns, two at\r\na time, should put our hands against the end of the wagon and push it\r\nthrough the sand, leaving the feeble horses little to do but keep out of\r\nthe way and hold up the tongue.  Perhaps it is well for one to know his\r\nfate at first, and get reconciled to it.  We had learned ours in one\r\nafternoon.  It was plain that we had to walk through the sand and shove\r\nthat wagon and those horses two hundred miles.  So we accepted the\r\nsituation, and from that time forth we never rode.  More than that, we\r\nstood regular and nearly constant watches pushing up behind.\r\n\r\nWe made seven miles, and camped in the desert.  Young Clagett (now member\r\nof Congress from Montana) unharnessed and fed and watered the horses;\r\nOliphant and I cut sagebrush, built the fire and brought water to cook\r\nwith; and old Mr. Ballou the blacksmith did the cooking.  This division\r\nof labor, and this appointment, was adhered to throughout the journey.\r\nWe had no tent, and so we slept under our blankets in the open plain.  We\r\nwere so tired that we slept soundly.\r\n\r\nWe were fifteen days making the trip--two hundred miles; thirteen,\r\nrather, for we lay by a couple of days, in one place, to let the horses\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nWe could really have accomplished the journey in ten days if we had towed\r\nthe horses behind the wagon, but we did not think of that until it was\r\ntoo late, and so went on shoving the horses and the wagon too when we\r\nmight have saved half the labor.  Parties who met us, occasionally,\r\nadvised us to put the horses in the wagon, but Mr. Ballou, through whose\r\niron-clad earnestness no sarcasm could pierce, said that that would not\r\ndo, because the provisions were exposed and would suffer, the horses\r\nbeing "bituminous from long deprivation."  The reader will excuse me from\r\ntranslating.  What Mr. Ballou customarily meant, when he used a long\r\nword, was a secret between himself and his Maker.  He was one of the best\r\nand kindest hearted men that ever graced a humble sphere of life.  He was\r\ngentleness and simplicity itself--and unselfishness, too.  Although he\r\nwas more than twice as old as the eldest of us, he never gave himself any\r\nairs, privileges, or exemptions on that account.  He did a young man\'s\r\nshare of the work; and did his share of conversing and entertaining from\r\nthe general stand-point of any age--not from the arrogant, overawing\r\nsummit-height of sixty years.  His one striking peculiarity was his\r\nPartingtonian fashion of loving and using big words for their own sakes,\r\nand independent of any bearing they might have upon the thought he was\r\npurposing to convey.  He always let his ponderous syllables fall with an\r\neasy unconsciousness that left them wholly without offensiveness.\r\nIn truth his air was so natural and so simple that one was always\r\ncatching himself accepting his stately sentences as meaning something,\r\nwhen they really meant nothing in the world.  If a word was long and\r\ngrand and resonant, that was sufficient to win the old man\'s love, and he\r\nwould drop that word into the most out-of-the-way place in a sentence or\r\na subject, and be as pleased with it as if it were perfectly luminous\r\nwith meaning.\r\n\r\nWe four always spread our common stock of blankets together on the frozen\r\nground, and slept side by side; and finding that our foolish, long-legged\r\nhound pup had a deal of animal heat in him, Oliphant got to admitting him\r\nto the bed, between himself and Mr. Ballou, hugging the dog\'s warm back\r\nto his breast and finding great comfort in it.  But in the night the pup\r\nwould get stretchy and brace his feet against the old man\'s back and\r\nshove, grunting complacently the while; and now and then, being warm and\r\nsnug, grateful and happy, he would paw the old man\'s back simply in\r\nexcess of comfort; and at yet other times he would dream of the chase and\r\nin his sleep tug at the old man\'s back hair and bark in his ear.  The old\r\ngentleman complained mildly about these familiarities, at last, and when\r\nhe got through with his statement he said that such a dog as that was not\r\na proper animal to admit to bed with tired men, because he was "so\r\nmeretricious in his movements and so organic in his emotions."  We turned\r\nthe dog out.\r\n\r\nIt was a hard, wearing, toilsome journey, but it had its bright side; for\r\nafter each day was done and our wolfish hunger appeased with a hot supper\r\nof fried bacon, bread, molasses and black coffee, the pipe-smoking,\r\nsong-singing and yarn-spinning around the evening camp-fire in the still\r\nsolitudes of the desert was a happy, care-free sort of recreation that\r\nseemed the very summit and culmination of earthly luxury.\r\n\r\nIt is a kind of life that has a potent charm for all men, whether city or\r\ncountry-bred.  We are descended from desert-lounging Arabs, and countless\r\nages of growth toward perfect civilization have failed to root out of us\r\nthe nomadic instinct.  We all confess to a gratified thrill at the\r\nthought of "camping out."\r\n\r\nOnce we made twenty-five miles in a day, and once we made forty miles\r\n(through the Great American Desert), and ten miles beyond--fifty in all\r\n--in twenty-three hours, without halting to eat, drink or rest.  To stretch\r\nout and go to sleep, even on stony and frozen ground, after pushing a\r\nwagon and two horses fifty miles, is a delight so supreme that for the\r\nmoment it almost seems cheap at the price.\r\n\r\nWe camped two days in the neighborhood of the "Sink of the Humboldt."\r\nWe tried to use the strong alkaline water of the Sink, but it would not\r\nanswer.  It was like drinking lye, and not weak lye, either.  It left a\r\ntaste in the mouth, bitter and every way execrable, and a burning in the\r\nstomach that was very uncomfortable.  We put molasses in it, but that\r\nhelped it very little; we added a pickle, yet the alkali was the\r\nprominent taste and so it was unfit for drinking.\r\n\r\nThe coffee we made of this water was the meanest compound man has yet\r\ninvented.  It was really viler to the taste than the unameliorated water\r\nitself.  Mr. Ballou, being the architect and builder of the beverage felt\r\nconstrained to endorse and uphold it, and so drank half a cup, by little\r\nsips, making shift to praise it faintly the while, but finally threw out\r\nthe remainder, and said frankly it was "too technical for him."\r\n\r\nBut presently we found a spring of fresh water, convenient, and then,\r\nwith nothing to mar our enjoyment, and no stragglers to interrupt it, we\r\nentered into our rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Sink, we traveled along the Humboldt river a little\r\nway.  People accustomed to the monster mile-wide Mississippi, grow\r\naccustomed to associating the term "river" with a high degree of watery\r\ngrandeur.  Consequently, such people feel rather disappointed when they\r\nstand on the shores of the Humboldt or the Carson and find that a "river"\r\nin Nevada is a sickly rivulet which is just the counterpart of the Erie\r\ncanal in all respects save that the canal is twice as long and four times\r\nas deep.  One of the pleasantest and most invigorating exercises one can\r\ncontrive is to run and jump across the Humboldt river till he is\r\noverheated, and then drink it dry.\r\n\r\nOn the fifteenth day we completed our march of two hundred miles and\r\nentered Unionville, Humboldt county, in the midst of a driving\r\nsnow-storm.  Unionville consisted of eleven cabins and a liberty-pole.\r\nSix of the cabins were strung along one side of a deep canyon, and the\r\nother five faced them.  The rest of the landscape was made up of bleak\r\nmountain walls that rose so high into the sky from both sides of the\r\ncanyon that the village was left, as it were, far down in the bottom of a\r\ncrevice. It was always daylight on the mountain tops a long time before\r\nthe darkness lifted and revealed Unionville.\r\n\r\nWe built a small, rude cabin in the side of the crevice and roofed it\r\nwith canvas, leaving a corner open to serve as a chimney, through which\r\nthe cattle used to tumble occasionally, at night, and mash our furniture\r\nand interrupt our sleep.  It was very cold weather and fuel was scarce.\r\nIndians brought brush and bushes several miles on their backs; and when\r\nwe could catch a laden Indian it was well--and when we could not (which\r\nwas the rule, not the exception), we shivered and bore it.\r\n\r\nI confess, without shame, that I expected to find masses of silver lying\r\nall about the ground.  I expected to see it glittering in the sun on the\r\nmountain summits.  I said nothing about this, for some instinct told me\r\nthat I might possibly have an exaggerated idea about it, and so if I\r\nbetrayed my thought I might bring derision upon myself.  Yet I was as\r\nperfectly satisfied in my own mind as I could be of anything, that I was\r\ngoing to gather up, in a day or two, or at furthest a week or two, silver\r\nenough to make me satisfactorily wealthy--and so my fancy was already\r\nbusy with plans for spending this money.  The first opportunity that\r\noffered, I sauntered carelessly away from the cabin, keeping an eye on\r\nthe other boys, and stopping and contemplating the sky when they seemed\r\nto be observing me; but as soon as the coast was manifestly clear, I fled\r\naway as guiltily as a thief might have done and never halted till I was\r\nfar beyond sight and call.  Then I began my search with a feverish\r\nexcitement that was brimful of expectation--almost of certainty.\r\nI crawled about the ground, seizing and examining bits of stone, blowing\r\nthe dust from them or rubbing them on my clothes, and then peering at\r\nthem with anxious hope.  Presently I found a bright fragment and my heart\r\nbounded!  I hid behind a boulder and polished it and scrutinized it with\r\na nervous eagerness and a delight that was more pronounced than absolute\r\ncertainty itself could have afforded.  The more I examined the fragment\r\nthe more I was convinced that I had found the door to fortune.  I marked\r\nthe spot and carried away my specimen.  Up and down the rugged mountain\r\nside I searched, with always increasing interest and always augmenting\r\ngratitude that I had come to Humboldt and come in time.  Of all the\r\nexperiences of my life, this secret search among the hidden treasures of\r\nsilver-land was the nearest to unmarred ecstasy.  It was a delirious\r\nrevel.\r\n\r\nBy and by, in the bed of a shallow rivulet, I found a deposit of shining\r\nyellow scales, and my breath almost forsook me!  A gold mine, and in my\r\nsimplicity I had been content with vulgar silver!  I was so excited that\r\nI half believed my overwrought imagination was deceiving me.  Then a fear\r\ncame upon me that people might be observing me and would guess my secret.\r\nMoved by this thought, I made a circuit of the place, and ascended a\r\nknoll to reconnoiter.  Solitude.  No creature was near.  Then I returned\r\nto my mine, fortifying myself against possible disappointment, but my\r\nfears were groundless--the shining scales were still there.  I set about\r\nscooping them out, and for an hour I toiled down the windings of the\r\nstream and robbed its bed.  But at last the descending sun warned me to\r\ngive up the quest, and I turned homeward laden with wealth.  As I walked\r\nalong I could not help smiling at the thought of my being so excited over\r\nmy fragment of silver when a nobler metal was almost under my nose.  In\r\nthis little time the former had so fallen in my estimation that once or\r\ntwice I was on the point of throwing it away.\r\n\r\nThe boys were as hungry as usual, but I could eat nothing.  Neither could\r\nI talk.  I was full of dreams and far away.  Their conversation\r\ninterrupted the flow of my fancy somewhat, and annoyed me a little, too.\r\nI despised the sordid and commonplace things they talked about.  But as\r\nthey proceeded, it began to amuse me.  It grew to be rare fun to hear\r\nthem planning their poor little economies and sighing over possible\r\nprivations and distresses when a gold mine, all our own, lay within sight\r\nof the cabin and I could point it out at any moment.  Smothered hilarity\r\nbegan to oppress me, presently.  It was hard to resist the impulse to\r\nburst out with exultation and reveal everything; but I did resist.  I\r\nsaid within myself that I would filter the great news through my lips\r\ncalmly and be serene as a summer morning while I watched its effect in\r\ntheir faces.  I said:\r\n\r\n"Where have you all been?"\r\n\r\n"Prospecting."\r\n\r\n"What did you find?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing."\r\n\r\n"Nothing?  What do you think of the country?"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t tell, yet," said Mr. Ballou, who was an old gold miner, and had\r\nlikewise had considerable experience among the silver mines.\r\n\r\n"Well, haven\'t you formed any sort of opinion?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, a sort of a one.  It\'s fair enough here, may be, but overrated.\r\nSeven thousand dollar ledges are scarce, though.\r\n\r\n"That Sheba may be rich enough, but we don\'t own it; and besides, the rock\r\nis so full of base metals that all the science in the world can\'t work\r\nit.  We\'ll not starve, here, but we\'ll not get rich, I\'m afraid."\r\n\r\n"So you think the prospect is pretty poor?"\r\n\r\n"No name for it!"\r\n\r\n"Well, we\'d better go back, hadn\'t we?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, not yet--of course not.  We\'ll try it a riffle, first."\r\n\r\n"Suppose, now--this is merely a supposition, you know--suppose you could\r\nfind a ledge that would yield, say, a hundred and fifty dollars a ton\r\n--would that satisfy you?"\r\n\r\n"Try us once!" from the whole party.\r\n\r\n"Or suppose--merely a supposition, of course--suppose you were to find a\r\nledge that would yield two thousand dollars a ton--would that satisfy\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"Here--what do you mean?  What are you coming at?  Is there some mystery\r\nbehind all this?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind.  I am not saying anything.  You know perfectly well there\r\nare no rich mines here--of course you do.  Because you have been around\r\nand examined for yourselves.  Anybody would know that, that had been\r\naround.  But just for the sake of argument, suppose--in a kind of general\r\nway--suppose some person were to tell you that two-thousand-dollar ledges\r\nwere simply contemptible--contemptible, understand--and that right yonder\r\nin sight of this very cabin there were piles of pure gold and pure\r\nsilver--oceans of it--enough to make you all rich in twenty-four hours!\r\nCome!"\r\n\r\n"I should say he was as crazy as a loon!" said old Ballou, but wild with\r\nexcitement, nevertheless.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," said I, "I don\'t say anything--I haven\'t been around, you\r\nknow, and of course don\'t know anything--but all I ask of you is to cast\r\nyour eye on that, for instance, and tell me what you think of it!" and I\r\ntossed my treasure before them.\r\n\r\nThere was an eager scramble for it, and a closing of heads together over\r\nit under the candle-light.  Then old Ballou said:\r\n\r\n"Think of it?  I think it is nothing but a lot of granite rubbish and\r\nnasty glittering mica that isn\'t worth ten cents an acre!"\r\n\r\nSo vanished my dream.  So melted my wealth away.  So toppled my airy\r\ncastle to the earth and left me stricken and forlorn.\r\n\r\nMoralizing, I observed, then, that "all that glitters is not gold."\r\n\r\nMr. Ballou said I could go further than that, and lay it up among my\r\ntreasures of knowledge, that nothing that glitters is gold.  So I learned\r\nthen, once for all, that gold in its native state is but dull,\r\nunornamental stuff, and that only low-born metals excite the admiration\r\nof the ignorant with an ostentatious glitter.  However, like the rest of\r\nthe world, I still go on underrating men of gold and glorifying men of\r\nmica.  Commonplace human nature cannot rise above that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nTrue knowledge of the nature of silver mining came fast enough.  We went\r\nout "prospecting" with Mr. Ballou.  We climbed the mountain sides, and\r\nclambered among sage-brush, rocks and snow till we were ready to drop\r\nwith exhaustion, but found no silver--nor yet any gold.  Day after day we\r\ndid this.  Now and then we came upon holes burrowed a few feet into the\r\ndeclivities and apparently abandoned; and now and then we found one or\r\ntwo listless men still burrowing.  But there was no appearance of silver.\r\nThese holes were the beginnings of tunnels, and the purpose was to drive\r\nthem hundreds of feet into the mountain, and some day tap the hidden\r\nledge where the silver was.  Some day!  It seemed far enough away, and\r\nvery hopeless and dreary.  Day after day we toiled, and climbed and\r\nsearched, and we younger partners grew sicker and still sicker of the\r\npromiseless toil.  At last we halted under a beetling rampart of rock\r\nwhich projected from the earth high upon the mountain.  Mr. Ballou broke\r\noff some fragments with a hammer, and examined them long and attentively\r\nwith a small eye-glass; threw them away and broke off more; said this\r\nrock was quartz, and quartz was the sort of rock that contained silver.\r\nContained it!  I had thought that at least it would be caked on the\r\noutside of it like a kind of veneering.  He still broke off pieces and\r\ncritically examined them, now and then wetting the piece with his tongue\r\nand applying the glass.  At last he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got it!"\r\n\r\nWe were full of anxiety in a moment.  The rock was clean and white, where\r\nit was broken, and across it ran a ragged thread of blue.  He said that\r\nthat little thread had silver in it, mixed with base metal, such as lead\r\nand antimony, and other rubbish, and that there was a speck or two of\r\ngold visible.  After a great deal of effort we managed to discern some\r\nlittle fine yellow specks, and judged that a couple of tons of them\r\nmassed together might make a gold dollar, possibly.  We were not\r\njubilant, but Mr. Ballou said there were worse ledges in the world than\r\nthat.  He saved what he called the "richest" piece of the rock, in order\r\nto determine its value by the process called the "fire-assay."  Then we\r\nnamed the mine "Monarch of the Mountains" (modesty of nomenclature is not\r\na prominent feature in the mines), and Mr. Ballou wrote out and stuck up\r\nthe following "notice," preserving a copy to be entered upon the books in\r\nthe mining recorder\'s office in the town.\r\n\r\n      "NOTICE."\r\n\r\n      "We the undersigned claim three claims, of three hundred feet each\r\n      (and one for discovery), on this silver-bearing quartz lead or lode,\r\n      extending north and south from this notice, with all its dips,\r\n      spurs, and angles, variations and sinuosities, together with fifty\r\n      feet of ground on either side for working the same."\r\n\r\nWe put our names to it and tried to feel that our fortunes were made.\r\nBut when we talked the matter all over with Mr. Ballou, we felt depressed\r\nand dubious.  He said that this surface quartz was not all there was of\r\nour mine; but that the wall or ledge of rock called the "Monarch of the\r\nMountains," extended down hundreds and hundreds of feet into the earth\r\n--he illustrated by saying it was like a curb-stone, and maintained a\r\nnearly uniform thickness-say twenty feet--away down into the bowels of\r\nthe earth, and was perfectly distinct from the casing rock on each side\r\nof it; and that it kept to itself, and maintained its distinctive\r\ncharacter always, no matter how deep it extended into the earth or how\r\nfar it stretched itself through and across the hills and valleys.  He\r\nsaid it might be a mile deep and ten miles long, for all we knew; and\r\nthat wherever we bored into it above ground or below, we would find gold\r\nand silver in it, but no gold or silver in the meaner rock it was cased\r\nbetween.  And he said that down in the great depths of the ledge was its\r\nrichness, and the deeper it went the richer it grew.  Therefore, instead\r\nof working here on the surface, we must either bore down into the rock\r\nwith a shaft till we came to where it was rich--say a hundred feet or so\r\n--or else we must go down into the valley and bore a long tunnel into the\r\nmountain side and tap the ledge far under the earth.  To do either was\r\nplainly the labor of months; for we could blast and bore only a few feet\r\na day--some five or six.  But this was not all.  He said that after we\r\ngot the ore out it must be hauled in wagons to a distant silver-mill,\r\nground up, and the silver extracted by a tedious and costly process.  Our\r\nfortune seemed a century away!\r\n\r\nBut we went to work.  We decided to sink a shaft.  So, for a week we\r\nclimbed the mountain, laden with picks, drills, gads, crowbars, shovels,\r\ncans of blasting powder and coils of fuse and strove with might and main.\r\nAt first the rock was broken and loose and we dug it up with picks and\r\nthrew it out with shovels, and the hole progressed very well.  But the\r\nrock became more compact, presently, and gads and crowbars came into\r\nplay.  But shortly nothing could make an impression but blasting powder.\r\n\r\nThat was the weariest work!  One of us held the iron drill in its place\r\nand another would strike with an eight-pound sledge--it was like driving\r\nnails on a large scale.  In the course of an hour or two the drill would\r\nreach a depth of two or three feet, making a hole a couple of inches in\r\ndiameter.  We would put in a charge of powder, insert half a yard of\r\nfuse, pour in sand and gravel and ram it down, then light the fuse and\r\nrun.  When the explosion came and the rocks and smoke shot into the air,\r\nwe would go back and find about a bushel of that hard, rebellious quartz\r\njolted out.  Nothing more.  One week of this satisfied me.  I resigned.\r\nClagget and Oliphant followed.  Our shaft was only twelve feet deep.  We\r\ndecided that a tunnel was the thing we wanted.\r\n\r\nSo we went down the mountain side and worked a week; at the end of which\r\ntime we had blasted a tunnel about deep enough to hide a hogshead in, and\r\njudged that about nine hundred feet more of it would reach the ledge.\r\nI resigned again, and the other boys only held out one day longer.\r\nWe decided that a tunnel was not what we wanted.  We wanted a ledge that\r\nwas already "developed."  There were none in the camp.\r\n\r\nWe dropped the "Monarch" for the time being.\r\n\r\nMeantime the camp was filling up with people, and there was a constantly\r\ngrowing excitement about our Humboldt mines.  We fell victims to the\r\nepidemic and strained every nerve to acquire more "feet."  We prospected\r\nand took up new claims, put "notices" on them and gave them grandiloquent\r\nnames.  We traded some of our "feet" for "feet" in other people\'s claims.\r\nIn a little while we owned largely in the "Gray Eagle," the "Columbiana,"\r\nthe "Branch Mint," the "Maria Jane," the "Universe," the\r\n"Root-Hog-or-Die," the "Samson and Delilah," the "Treasure Trove," the\r\n"Golconda," the "Sultana," the "Boomerang," the "Great Republic," the\r\n"Grand Mogul," and fifty other "mines" that had never been molested by a\r\nshovel or scratched with a pick.  We had not less than thirty thousand\r\n"feet" apiece in the "richest mines on earth" as the frenzied cant\r\nphrased it--and were in debt to the butcher.  We were stark mad with\r\nexcitement--drunk with happiness--smothered under mountains of\r\nprospective wealth--arrogantly compassionate toward the plodding millions\r\nwho knew not our marvellous canyon--but our credit was not good at the\r\ngrocer\'s.\r\n\r\nIt was the strangest phase of life one can imagine.  It was a beggars\'\r\nrevel.  There was nothing doing in the district--no mining--no milling\r\n--no productive effort--no income--and not enough money in the entire camp\r\nto buy a corner lot in an eastern village, hardly; and yet a stranger\r\nwould have supposed he was walking among bloated millionaires.\r\nProspecting parties swarmed out of town with the first flush of dawn, and\r\nswarmed in again at nightfall laden with spoil--rocks.  Nothing but\r\nrocks.  Every man\'s pockets were full of them; the floor of his cabin was\r\nlittered with them; they were disposed in labeled rows on his shelves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nI met men at every turn who owned from one thousand to thirty thousand\r\n"feet" in undeveloped silver mines, every single foot of which they\r\nbelieved would shortly be worth from fifty to a thousand dollars--and as\r\noften as any other way they were men who had not twenty-five dollars in\r\nthe world.  Every man you met had his new mine to boast of, and his\r\n"specimens" ready; and if the opportunity offered, he would infallibly\r\nback you into a corner and offer as a favor to you, not to him, to part\r\nwith just a few feet in the "Golden Age," or the "Sarah Jane," or some\r\nother unknown stack of croppings, for money enough to get a "square meal"\r\nwith, as the phrase went.  And you were never to reveal that he had made\r\nyou the offer at such a ruinous price, for it was only out of friendship\r\nfor you that he was willing to make the sacrifice.  Then he would fish a\r\npiece of rock out of his pocket, and after looking mysteriously around as\r\nif he feared he might be waylaid and robbed if caught with such wealth in\r\nhis possession, he would dab the rock against his tongue, clap an\r\neyeglass to it, and exclaim:\r\n\r\n"Look at that!  Right there in that red dirt!  See it?  See the specks of\r\ngold?  And the streak of silver?  That\'s from the Uncle Abe.  There\'s a\r\nhundred thousand tons like that in sight!  Right in sight, mind you!\r\nAnd when we get down on it and the ledge comes in solid, it will be the\r\nrichest thing in the world!  Look at the assay!  I don\'t want you to\r\nbelieve me--look at the assay!"\r\n\r\nThen he would get out a greasy sheet of paper which showed that the\r\nportion of rock assayed had given evidence of containing silver and gold\r\nin the proportion of so many hundreds or thousands of dollars to the ton.\r\n\r\n\r\nI little knew, then, that the custom was to hunt out the richest piece of\r\nrock and get it assayed!  Very often, that piece, the size of a filbert,\r\nwas the only fragment in a ton that had a particle of metal in it--and\r\nyet the assay made it pretend to represent the average value of the ton\r\nof rubbish it came from!\r\n\r\nOn such a system of assaying as that, the Humboldt world had gone crazy.\r\nOn the authority of such assays its newspaper correspondents were\r\nfrothing about rock worth four and seven thousand dollars a ton!\r\n\r\nAnd does the reader remember, a few pages back, the calculations, of a\r\nquoted correspondent, whereby the ore is to be mined and shipped all the\r\nway to England, the metals extracted, and the gold and silver contents\r\nreceived back by the miners as clear profit, the copper, antimony and\r\nother things in the ore being sufficient to pay all the expenses\r\nincurred?  Everybody\'s head was full of such "calculations" as those\r\n--such raving insanity, rather.  Few people took work into their\r\ncalculations--or outlay of money either; except the work and expenditures\r\nof other people.\r\n\r\nWe never touched our tunnel or our shaft again.  Why?  Because we judged\r\nthat we had learned the real secret of success in silver mining--which\r\nwas, not to mine the silver ourselves by the sweat of our brows and the\r\nlabor of our hands, but to sell the ledges to the dull slaves of toil and\r\nlet them do the mining!\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Carson, the Secretary and I had purchased "feet" from\r\nvarious Esmeralda stragglers.  We had expected immediate returns of\r\nbullion, but were only afflicted with regular and constant "assessments"\r\ninstead--demands for money wherewith to develop the said mines.  These\r\nassessments had grown so oppressive that it seemed necessary to look into\r\nthe matter personally.  Therefore I projected a pilgrimage to Carson and\r\nthence to Esmeralda.  I bought a horse and started, in company with\r\nMr. Ballou and a gentleman named Ollendorff, a Prussian--not the party\r\nwho has inflicted so much suffering on the world with his wretched\r\nforeign grammars, with their interminable repetitions of questions which\r\nnever have occurred and are never likely to occur in any conversation\r\namong human beings.  We rode through a snow-storm for two or three days,\r\nand arrived at "Honey Lake Smith\'s," a sort of isolated inn on the Carson\r\nriver.  It was a two-story log house situated on a small knoll in the\r\nmidst of the vast basin or desert through which the sickly Carson winds\r\nits melancholy way.  Close to the house were the Overland stage stables,\r\nbuilt of sun-dried bricks.  There was not another building within several\r\nleagues of the place.  Towards sunset about twenty hay-wagons arrived and\r\ncamped around the house and all the teamsters came in to supper--a very,\r\nvery rough set.  There were one or two Overland stage drivers there,\r\nalso, and half a dozen vagabonds and stragglers; consequently the house\r\nwas well crowded.\r\n\r\nWe walked out, after supper, and visited a small Indian camp in the\r\nvicinity.  The Indians were in a great hurry about something, and were\r\npacking up and getting away as fast as they could.  In their broken\r\nEnglish they said, "By\'m-by, heap water!" and by the help of signs made\r\nus understand that in their opinion a flood was coming.  The weather was\r\nperfectly clear, and this was not the rainy season.  There was about a\r\nfoot of water in the insignificant river--or maybe two feet; the stream\r\nwas not wider than a back alley in a village, and its banks were scarcely\r\nhigher than a man\'s head.\r\n\r\nSo, where was the flood to come from?  We canvassed the subject awhile\r\nand then concluded it was a ruse, and that the Indians had some better\r\nreason for leaving in a hurry than fears of a flood in such an\r\nexceedingly dry time.\r\n\r\nAt seven in the evening we went to bed in the second story--with our\r\nclothes on, as usual, and all three in the same bed, for every available\r\nspace on the floors, chairs, etc., was in request, and even then there\r\nwas barely room for the housing of the inn\'s guests.  An hour later we\r\nwere awakened by a great turmoil, and springing out of bed we picked our\r\nway nimbly among the ranks of snoring teamsters on the floor and got to\r\nthe front windows of the long room.  A glance revealed a strange\r\nspectacle, under the moonlight.  The crooked Carson was full to the brim,\r\nand its waters were raging and foaming in the wildest way--sweeping\r\naround the sharp bends at a furious speed, and bearing on their surface a\r\nchaos of logs, brush and all sorts of rubbish.  A depression, where its\r\nbed had once been, in other times, was already filling, and in one or two\r\nplaces the water was beginning to wash over the main bank.  Men were\r\nflying hither and thither, bringing cattle and wagons close up to the\r\nhouse, for the spot of high ground on which it stood extended only some\r\nthirty feet in front and about a hundred in the rear.  Close to the old\r\nriver bed just spoken of, stood a little log stable, and in this our\r\nhorses were lodged.\r\n\r\nWhile we looked, the waters increased so fast in this place that in a few\r\nminutes a torrent was roaring by the little stable and its margin\r\nencroaching steadily on the logs.  We suddenly realized that this flood\r\nwas not a mere holiday spectacle, but meant damage--and not only to the\r\nsmall log stable but to the Overland buildings close to the main river,\r\nfor the waves had now come ashore and were creeping about the foundations\r\nand invading the great hay-corral adjoining.  We ran down and joined the\r\ncrowd of excited men and frightened animals.  We waded knee-deep into the\r\nlog stable, unfastened the horses and waded out almost waist-deep, so\r\nfast the waters increased.  Then the crowd rushed in a body to the\r\nhay-corral and began to tumble down the huge stacks of baled hay and roll\r\nthe bales up on the high ground by the house.  Meantime it was discovered\r\nthat Owens, an overland driver, was missing, and a man ran to the large\r\nstable, and wading in, boot-top deep, discovered him asleep in his bed,\r\nawoke him, and waded out again.  But Owens was drowsy and resumed his\r\nnap; but only for a minute or two, for presently he turned in his bed,\r\nhis hand dropped over the side and came in contact with the cold water!\r\nIt was up level with the mattress!  He waded out, breast-deep, almost,\r\nand the next moment the sun-burned bricks melted down like sugar and the\r\nbig building crumbled to a ruin and was washed away in a twinkling.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o\'clock only the roof of the little log stable was out of\r\nwater, and our inn was on an island in mid-ocean.  As far as the eye\r\ncould reach, in the moonlight, there was no desert visible, but only a\r\nlevel waste of shining water.  The Indians were true prophets, but how\r\ndid they get their information?  I am not able to answer the question.\r\nWe remained cooped up eight days and nights with that curious crew.\r\nSwearing, drinking and card playing were the order of the day, and\r\noccasionally a fight was thrown in for variety.  Dirt and vermin--but let\r\nus forget those features; their profusion is simply inconceivable--it is\r\nbetter that they remain so.\r\n\r\nThere were two men----however, this chapter is long enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nThere were two men in the company who caused me particular discomfort.\r\nOne was a little Swede, about twenty-five years old, who knew only one\r\nsong, and he was forever singing it.  By day we were all crowded into one\r\nsmall, stifling bar-room, and so there was no escaping this person\'s\r\nmusic.  Through all the profanity, whisky-guzzling, "old sledge" and\r\nquarreling, his monotonous song meandered with never a variation in its\r\ntiresome sameness, and it seemed to me, at last, that I would be content\r\nto die, in order to be rid of the torture.  The other man was a stalwart\r\nruffian called "Arkansas," who carried two revolvers in his belt and a\r\nbowie knife projecting from his boot, and who was always drunk and always\r\nsuffering for a fight.  But he was so feared, that nobody would\r\naccommodate him.  He would try all manner of little wary ruses to entrap\r\nsomebody into an offensive remark, and his face would light up now and\r\nthen when he fancied he was fairly on the scent of a fight, but\r\ninvariably his victim would elude his toils and then he would show a\r\ndisappointment that was almost pathetic.  The landlord, Johnson, was a\r\nmeek, well-meaning fellow, and Arkansas fastened on him early, as a\r\npromising subject, and gave him no rest day or night, for awhile.  On the\r\nfourth morning, Arkansas got drunk and sat himself down to wait for an\r\nopportunity.  Presently Johnson came in, just comfortably sociable with\r\nwhisky, and said:\r\n\r\n"I reckon the Pennsylvania \'lection--"\r\n\r\nArkansas raised his finger impressively and Johnson stopped.  Arkansas\r\nrose unsteadily and confronted him.  Said he:\r\n\r\n"Wha-what do you know a--about Pennsylvania?  Answer me that.  Wha--what\r\ndo you know \'bout Pennsylvania?"\r\n\r\n"I was only goin\' to say--"\r\n\r\n"You was only goin\' to say.  You was!  You was only goin\' to say--what\r\nwas you goin\' to say?  That\'s it!  That\'s what I want to know.  I want to\r\nknow wha--what you (\'ic) what you know about Pennsylvania, since you\'re\r\nmakin\' yourself so d---d free.  Answer me that!"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Arkansas, if you\'d only let me--"\r\n\r\n"Who\'s a henderin\' you?  Don\'t you insinuate nothing agin me!--don\'t you\r\ndo it.  Don\'t you come in here bullyin\' around, and cussin\' and goin\' on\r\nlike a lunatic--don\'t you do it.  \'Coz I won\'t stand it.  If fight\'s what\r\nyou want, out with it!  I\'m your man!  Out with it!"\r\n\r\nSaid Johnson, backing into a corner, Arkansas following, menacingly:\r\n\r\n"Why, I never said nothing, Mr. Arkansas.  You don\'t give a man no\r\nchance.  I was only goin\' to say that Pennsylvania was goin\' to have an\r\nelection next week--that was all--that was everything I was goin\' to say\r\n--I wish I may never stir if it wasn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Well then why d\'n\'t you say it?  What did you come swellin\' around that\r\nway for, and tryin\' to raise trouble?"\r\n\r\n"Why I didn\'t come swellin\' around, Mr. Arkansas--I just--"\r\n\r\n"I\'m a liar am I!  Ger-reat Caesar\'s ghost--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, please, Mr. Arkansas, I never meant such a thing as that, I wish I\r\nmay die if I did.  All the boys will tell you that I\'ve always spoke well\r\nof you, and respected you more\'n any man in the house.  Ask Smith.  Ain\'t\r\nit so, Smith?  Didn\'t I say, no longer ago than last night, that for a\r\nman that was a gentleman all the time and every way you took him, give me\r\nArkansas?  I\'ll leave it to any gentleman here if them warn\'t the very\r\nwords I used.  Come, now, Mr. Arkansas, le\'s take a drink--le\'s shake\r\nhands and take a drink.  Come up--everybody!  It\'s my treat.  Come up,\r\nBill, Tom, Bob, Scotty--come up.  I want you all to take a drink with me\r\nand Arkansas--old Arkansas, I call him--bully old Arkansas.  Gimme your\r\nhand agin.  Look at him, boys--just take a look at him.  Thar stands the\r\nwhitest man in America!--and the man that denies it has got to fight me,\r\nthat\'s all.  Gimme that old flipper agin!"\r\n\r\nThey embraced, with drunken affection on the landlord\'s part and\r\nunresponsive toleration on the part of Arkansas, who, bribed by a drink,\r\nwas disappointed of his prey once more.  But the foolish landlord was so\r\nhappy to have escaped butchery, that he went on talking when he ought to\r\nhave marched himself out of danger.  The consequence was that Arkansas\r\nshortly began to glower upon him dangerously, and presently said:\r\n\r\n"Lan\'lord, will you p-please make that remark over agin if you please?"\r\n\r\n"I was a-sayin\' to Scotty that my father was up\'ards of eighty year old\r\nwhen he died."\r\n\r\n"Was that all that you said?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that was all."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t say nothing but that?"\r\n\r\n"No--nothing."\r\n\r\nThen an uncomfortable silence.\r\n\r\nArkansas played with his glass a moment, lolling on his elbows on the\r\ncounter.  Then he meditatively scratched his left shin with his right\r\nboot, while the awkward silence continued.  But presently he loafed away\r\ntoward the stove, looking dissatisfied; roughly shouldered two or three\r\nmen out of a comfortable position; occupied it himself, gave a sleeping\r\ndog a kick that sent him howling under a bench, then spread his long legs\r\nand his blanket-coat tails apart and proceeded to warm his back.  In a\r\nlittle while he fell to grumbling to himself, and soon he slouched back\r\nto the bar and said:\r\n\r\n"Lan\'lord, what\'s your idea for rakin\' up old personalities and blowin\'\r\nabout your father?  Ain\'t this company agreeable to you?  Ain\'t it?  If\r\nthis company ain\'t agreeable to you, p\'r\'aps we\'d better leave.  Is that\r\nyour idea?  Is that what you\'re coming at?"\r\n\r\n"Why bless your soul, Arkansas, I warn\'t thinking of such a thing.  My\r\nfather and my mother--"\r\n\r\n"Lan\'lord, don\'t crowd a man!  Don\'t do it.  If nothing\'ll do you but a\r\ndisturbance, out with it like a man (\'ic)--but don\'t rake up old bygones\r\nand fling\'em in the teeth of a passel of people that wants to be\r\npeaceable if they could git a chance.  What\'s the matter with you this\r\nmornin\', anyway?  I never see a man carry on so."\r\n\r\n"Arkansas, I reely didn\'t mean no harm, and I won\'t go on with it if it\'s\r\nonpleasant to you.  I reckon my licker\'s got into my head, and what with\r\nthe flood, and havin\' so many to feed and look out for--"\r\n\r\n"So that\'s what\'s a-ranklin\' in your heart, is it?  You want us to leave\r\ndo you?  There\'s too many on us.  You want us to pack up and swim.  Is\r\nthat it?  Come!"\r\n\r\n"Please be reasonable, Arkansas.  Now you know that I ain\'t the man to--"\r\n\r\n"Are you a threatenin\' me?  Are you?  By George, the man don\'t live that\r\ncan skeer me!  Don\'t you try to come that game, my chicken--\'cuz I can\r\nstand a good deal, but I won\'t stand that.  Come out from behind that bar\r\ntill I clean you!  You want to drive us out, do you, you sneakin\'\r\nunderhanded hound!  Come out from behind that bar!  I\'ll learn you to\r\nbully and badger and browbeat a gentleman that\'s forever trying to\r\nbefriend you and keep you out of trouble!"\r\n\r\n"Please, Arkansas, please don\'t shoot!  If there\'s got to be bloodshed--"\r\n\r\n"Do you hear that, gentlemen?  Do you hear him talk about bloodshed?  So\r\nit\'s blood you want, is it, you ravin\' desperado!  You\'d made up your\r\nmind to murder somebody this mornin\'--I knowed it perfectly well.  I\'m\r\nthe man, am I?  It\'s me you\'re goin\' to murder, is it?  But you can\'t do\r\nit \'thout I get one chance first, you thievin\' black-hearted,\r\nwhite-livered son of a nigger!  Draw your weepon!"\r\n\r\nWith that, Arkansas began to shoot, and the landlord to clamber over\r\nbenches, men and every sort of obstacle in a frantic desire to escape.\r\nIn the midst of the wild hubbub the landlord crashed through a glass\r\ndoor, and as Arkansas charged after him the landlord\'s wife suddenly\r\nappeared in the doorway and confronted the desperado with a pair of\r\nscissors!  Her fury was magnificent.  With head erect and flashing eye\r\nshe stood a moment and then advanced, with her weapon raised.  The\r\nastonished ruffian hesitated, and then fell back a step.  She followed.\r\nShe backed him step by step into the middle of the bar-room, and then,\r\nwhile the wondering crowd closed up and gazed, she gave him such another\r\ntongue-lashing as never a cowed and shamefaced braggart got before,\r\nperhaps!  As she finished and retired victorious, a roar of applause\r\nshook the house, and every man ordered "drinks for the crowd" in one and\r\nthe same breath.\r\n\r\nThe lesson was entirely sufficient.  The reign of terror was over, and\r\nthe Arkansas domination broken for good.  During the rest of the season\r\nof island captivity, there was one man who sat apart in a state of\r\npermanent humiliation, never mixing in any quarrel or uttering a boast,\r\nand never resenting the insults the once cringing crew now constantly\r\nleveled at him, and that man was "Arkansas."\r\n\r\nBy the fifth or sixth morning the waters had subsided from the land, but\r\nthe stream in the old river bed was still high and swift and there was no\r\npossibility of crossing it.  On the eighth it was still too high for an\r\nentirely safe passage, but life in the inn had become next to\r\ninsupportable by reason of the dirt, drunkenness, fighting, etc., and so\r\nwe made an effort to get away.  In the midst of a heavy snow-storm we\r\nembarked in a canoe, taking our saddles aboard and towing our horses\r\nafter us by their halters.  The Prussian, Ollendorff, was in the bow,\r\nwith a paddle, Ballou paddled in the middle, and I sat in the stern\r\nholding the halters.  When the horses lost their footing and began to\r\nswim, Ollendorff got frightened, for there was great danger that the\r\nhorses would make our aim uncertain, and it was plain that if we failed\r\nto land at a certain spot the current would throw us off and almost\r\nsurely cast us into the main Carson, which was a boiling torrent, now.\r\nSuch a catastrophe would be death, in all probability, for we would be\r\nswept to sea in the "Sink" or overturned and drowned.  We warned\r\nOllendorff to keep his wits about him and handle himself carefully, but\r\nit was useless; the moment the bow touched the bank, he made a spring and\r\nthe canoe whirled upside down in ten-foot water.\r\n\r\nOllendorff seized some brush and dragged himself ashore, but Ballou and I\r\nhad to swim for it, encumbered with our overcoats.  But we held on to the\r\ncanoe, and although we were washed down nearly to the Carson, we managed\r\nto push the boat ashore and make a safe landing.  We were cold and\r\nwater-soaked, but safe.  The horses made a landing, too, but our saddles\r\nwere gone, of course.  We tied the animals in the sage-brush and there\r\nthey had to stay for twenty-four hours.  We baled out the canoe and\r\nferried over some food and blankets for them, but we slept one more night\r\nin the inn before making another venture on our journey.\r\n\r\nThe next morning it was still snowing furiously when we got away with our\r\nnew stock of saddles and accoutrements.  We mounted and started.  The\r\nsnow lay so deep on the ground that there was no sign of a road\r\nperceptible, and the snow-fall was so thick that we could not see more\r\nthan a hundred yards ahead, else we could have guided our course by the\r\nmountain ranges.  The case looked dubious, but Ollendorff said his\r\ninstinct was as sensitive as any compass, and that he could "strike a\r\nbee-line" for Carson city and never diverge from it.  He said that if he\r\nwere to straggle a single point out of the true line his instinct would\r\nassail him like an outraged conscience.  Consequently we dropped into his\r\nwake happy and content.  For half an hour we poked along warily enough,\r\nbut at the end of that time we came upon a fresh trail, and Ollendorff\r\nshouted proudly:\r\n\r\n"I knew I was as dead certain as a compass, boys!  Here we are, right in\r\nsomebody\'s tracks that will hunt the way for us without any trouble.\r\nLet\'s hurry up and join company with the party."\r\n\r\nSo we put the horses into as much of a trot as the deep snow would allow,\r\nand before long it was evident that we were gaining on our predecessors,\r\nfor the tracks grew more distinct.  We hurried along, and at the end of\r\nan hour the tracks looked still newer and fresher--but what surprised us\r\nwas, that the number of travelers in advance of us seemed to steadily\r\nincrease.  We wondered how so large a party came to be traveling at such\r\na time and in such a solitude.  Somebody suggested that it must be a\r\ncompany of soldiers from the fort, and so we accepted that solution and\r\njogged along a little faster still, for they could not be far off now.\r\nBut the tracks still multiplied, and we began to think the platoon of\r\nsoldiers was miraculously expanding into a regiment--Ballou said they had\r\nalready increased to five hundred!  Presently he stopped his horse and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"Boys, these are our own tracks, and we\'ve actually been circussing round\r\nand round in a circle for more than two hours, out here in this blind\r\ndesert!  By George this is perfectly hydraulic!"\r\n\r\nThen the old man waxed wroth and abusive.  He called Ollendorff all\r\nmanner of hard names--said he never saw such a lurid fool as he was, and\r\nended with the peculiarly venomous opinion that he "did not know as much\r\nas a logarythm!"\r\n\r\nWe certainly had been following our own tracks.  Ollendorff and his\r\n"mental compass" were in disgrace from that moment.\r\n\r\nAfter all our hard travel, here we were on the bank of the stream again,\r\nwith the inn beyond dimly outlined through the driving snow-fall.  While\r\nwe were considering what to do, the young Swede landed from the canoe and\r\ntook his pedestrian way Carson-wards, singing his same tiresome song\r\nabout his "sister and his brother" and "the child in the grave with its\r\nmother," and in a short minute faded and disappeared in the white\r\noblivion.  He was never heard of again.  He no doubt got bewildered and\r\nlost, and Fatigue delivered him over to Sleep and Sleep betrayed him to\r\nDeath.  Possibly he followed our treacherous tracks till he became\r\nexhausted and dropped.\r\n\r\nPresently the Overland stage forded the now fast receding stream and\r\nstarted toward Carson on its first trip since the flood came.  We\r\nhesitated no longer, now, but took up our march in its wake, and trotted\r\nmerrily along, for we had good confidence in the driver\'s bump of\r\nlocality.  But our horses were no match for the fresh stage team.  We\r\nwere soon left out of sight; but it was no matter, for we had the deep\r\nruts the wheels made for a guide.  By this time it was three in the\r\nafternoon, and consequently it was not very long before night came--and\r\nnot with a lingering twilight, but with a sudden shutting down like a\r\ncellar door, as is its habit in that country.  The snowfall was still as\r\nthick as ever, and of course we could not see fifteen steps before us;\r\nbut all about us the white glare of the snow-bed enabled us to discern\r\nthe smooth sugar-loaf mounds made by the covered sage-bushes, and just in\r\nfront of us the two faint grooves which we knew were the steadily filling\r\nand slowly disappearing wheel-tracks.\r\n\r\nNow those sage-bushes were all about the same height--three or four feet;\r\nthey stood just about seven feet apart, all over the vast desert; each of\r\nthem was a mere snow-mound, now; in any direction that you proceeded (the\r\nsame as in a well laid out orchard) you would find yourself moving down a\r\ndistinctly defined avenue, with a row of these snow-mounds an either side\r\nof it--an avenue the customary width of a road, nice and level in its\r\nbreadth, and rising at the sides in the most natural way, by reason of\r\nthe mounds.  But we had not thought of this.  Then imagine the chilly\r\nthrill that shot through us when it finally occurred to us, far in the\r\nnight, that since the last faint trace of the wheel-tracks had long ago\r\nbeen buried from sight, we might now be wandering down a mere sage-brush\r\navenue, miles away from the road and diverging further and further away\r\nfrom it all the time.  Having a cake of ice slipped down one\'s back is\r\nplacid comfort compared to it.  There was a sudden leap and stir of blood\r\nthat had been asleep for an hour, and as sudden a rousing of all the\r\ndrowsing activities in our minds and bodies.  We were alive and awake at\r\nonce--and shaking and quaking with consternation, too.  There was an\r\ninstant halting and dismounting, a bending low and an anxious scanning of\r\nthe road-bed.  Useless, of course; for if a faint depression could not be\r\ndiscerned from an altitude of four or five feet above it, it certainly\r\ncould not with one\'s nose nearly against it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nWe seemed to be in a road, but that was no proof.  We tested this by\r\nwalking off in various directions--the regular snow-mounds and the\r\nregular avenues between them convinced each man that he had found the\r\ntrue road, and that the others had found only false ones.  Plainly the\r\nsituation was desperate.  We were cold and stiff and the horses were\r\ntired.  We decided to build a sage-brush fire and camp out till morning.\r\nThis was wise, because if we were wandering from the right road and the\r\nsnow-storm continued another day our case would be the next thing to\r\nhopeless if we kept on.\r\n\r\nAll agreed that a camp fire was what would come nearest to saving us,\r\nnow, and so we set about building it.  We could find no matches, and so\r\nwe tried to make shift with the pistols.  Not a man in the party had ever\r\ntried to do such a thing before, but not a man in the party doubted that\r\nit could be done, and without any trouble--because every man in the party\r\nhad read about it in books many a time and had naturally come to believe\r\nit, with trusting simplicity, just as he had long ago accepted and\r\nbelieved that other common book-fraud about Indians and lost hunters\r\nmaking a fire by rubbing two dry sticks together.\r\n\r\nWe huddled together on our knees in the deep snow, and the horses put\r\ntheir noses together and bowed their patient heads over us; and while the\r\nfeathery flakes eddied down and turned us into a group of white statuary,\r\nwe proceeded with the momentous experiment.  We broke twigs from a sage\r\nbush and piled them on a little cleared place in the shelter of our\r\nbodies.  In the course of ten or fifteen minutes all was ready, and then,\r\nwhile conversation ceased and our pulses beat low with anxious suspense,\r\nOllendorff applied his revolver, pulled the trigger and blew the pile\r\nclear out of the county!  It was the flattest failure that ever was.\r\n\r\nThis was distressing, but it paled before a greater horror--the horses\r\nwere gone!  I had been appointed to hold the bridles, but in my absorbing\r\nanxiety over the pistol experiment I had unconsciously dropped them and\r\nthe released animals had walked off in the storm.  It was useless to try\r\nto follow them, for their footfalls could make no sound, and one could\r\npass within two yards of the creatures and never see them.  We gave them\r\nup without an effort at recovering them, and cursed the lying books that\r\nsaid horses would stay by their masters for protection and companionship\r\nin a distressful time like ours.\r\n\r\nWe were miserable enough, before; we felt still more forlorn, now.\r\nPatiently, but with blighted hope, we broke more sticks and piled them,\r\nand once more the Prussian shot them into annihilation.  Plainly, to\r\nlight a fire with a pistol was an art requiring practice and experience,\r\nand the middle of a desert at midnight in a snow-storm was not a good\r\nplace or time for the acquiring of the accomplishment.  We gave it up and\r\ntried the other.  Each man took a couple of sticks and fell to chafing\r\nthem together.  At the end of half an hour we were thoroughly chilled,\r\nand so were the sticks.  We bitterly execrated the Indians, the hunters\r\nand the books that had betrayed us with the silly device, and wondered\r\ndismally what was next to be done.  At this critical moment Mr. Ballou\r\nfished out four matches from the rubbish of an overlooked pocket.  To\r\nhave found four gold bars would have seemed poor and cheap good luck\r\ncompared to this.\r\n\r\nOne cannot think how good a match looks under such circumstances--or how\r\nlovable and precious, and sacredly beautiful to the eye.  This time we\r\ngathered sticks with high hopes; and when Mr. Ballou prepared to light\r\nthe first match, there was an amount of interest centred upon him that\r\npages of writing could not describe.  The match burned hopefully a\r\nmoment, and then went out.  It could not have carried more regret with it\r\nif it had been a human life.  The next match simply flashed and died.\r\nThe wind puffed the third one out just as it was on the imminent verge of\r\nsuccess.  We gathered together closer than ever, and developed a\r\nsolicitude that was rapt and painful, as Mr. Ballou scratched our last\r\nhope on his leg.  It lit, burned blue and sickly, and then budded into a\r\nrobust flame.  Shading it with his hands, the old gentleman bent\r\ngradually down and every heart went with him--everybody, too, for that\r\nmatter--and blood and breath stood still.  The flame touched the sticks\r\nat last, took gradual hold upon them--hesitated--took a stronger hold\r\n--hesitated again--held its breath five heart-breaking seconds, then gave a\r\nsort of human gasp and went out.\r\n\r\nNobody said a word for several minutes.  It was a solemn sort of silence;\r\neven the wind put on a stealthy, sinister quiet, and made no more noise\r\nthan the falling flakes of snow.  Finally a sad-voiced conversation\r\nbegan, and it was soon apparent that in each of our hearts lay the\r\nconviction that this was our last night with the living.  I had so hoped\r\nthat I was the only one who felt so.  When the others calmly acknowledged\r\ntheir conviction, it sounded like the summons itself.  Ollendorff said:\r\n\r\n"Brothers, let us die together.  And let us go without one hard feeling\r\ntowards each other.  Let us forget and forgive bygones.  I know that you\r\nhave felt hard towards me for turning over the canoe, and for knowing too\r\nmuch and leading you round and round in the snow--but I meant well;\r\nforgive me.  I acknowledge freely that I have had hard feelings against\r\nMr. Ballou for abusing me and calling me a logarythm, which is a thing I\r\ndo not know what, but no doubt a thing considered disgraceful and\r\nunbecoming in America, and it has scarcely been out of my mind and has\r\nhurt me a great deal--but let it go; I forgive Mr. Ballou with all my\r\nheart, and--"\r\n\r\nPoor Ollendorff broke down and the tears came.  He was not alone, for I\r\nwas crying too, and so was Mr. Ballou.  Ollendorff got his voice again\r\nand forgave me for things I had done and said.  Then he got out his\r\nbottle of whisky and said that whether he lived or died he would never\r\ntouch another drop.  He said he had given up all hope of life, and\r\nalthough ill-prepared, was ready to submit humbly to his fate; that he\r\nwished he could be spared a little longer, not for any selfish reason,\r\nbut to make a thorough reform in his character, and by devoting himself\r\nto helping the poor, nursing the sick, and pleading with the people to\r\nguard themselves against the evils of intemperance, make his life a\r\nbeneficent example to the young, and lay it down at last with the\r\nprecious reflection that it had not been lived in vain.  He ended by\r\nsaying that his reform should begin at this moment, even here in the\r\npresence of death, since no longer time was to be vouchsafed wherein to\r\nprosecute it to men\'s help and benefit--and with that he threw away the\r\nbottle of whisky.\r\n\r\nMr. Ballou made remarks of similar purport, and began the reform he could\r\nnot live to continue, by throwing away the ancient pack of cards that had\r\nsolaced our captivity during the flood and made it bearable.\r\n\r\nHe said he never gambled, but still was satisfied that the meddling with\r\ncards in any way was immoral and injurious, and no man could be wholly\r\npure and blemishless without eschewing them.  "And therefore," continued\r\nhe, "in doing this act I already feel more in sympathy with that\r\nspiritual saturnalia necessary to entire and obsolete reform."  These\r\nrolling syllables touched him as no intelligible eloquence could have\r\ndone, and the old man sobbed with a mournfulness not unmingled with\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nMy own remarks were of the same tenor as those of my comrades, and I know\r\nthat the feelings that prompted them were heartfelt and sincere.  We were\r\nall sincere, and all deeply moved and earnest, for we were in the\r\npresence of death and without hope.  I threw away my pipe, and in doing\r\nit felt that at last I was free of a hated vice and one that had ridden\r\nme like a tyrant all my days.  While I yet talked, the thought of the\r\ngood I might have done in the world and the still greater good I might\r\nnow do, with these new incentives and higher and better aims to guide me\r\nif I could only be spared a few years longer, overcame me and the tears\r\ncame again.  We put our arms about each other\'s necks and awaited the\r\nwarning drowsiness that precedes death by freezing.\r\n\r\nIt came stealing over us presently, and then we bade each other a last\r\nfarewell.  A delicious dreaminess wrought its web about my yielding\r\nsenses, while the snow-flakes wove a winding sheet about my conquered\r\nbody.  Oblivion came.  The battle of life was done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nI do not know how long I was in a state of forgetfulness, but it seemed\r\nan age.  A vague consciousness grew upon me by degrees, and then came a\r\ngathering anguish of pain in my limbs and through all my body.  I\r\nshuddered.  The thought flitted through my brain, "this is death--this is\r\nthe hereafter."\r\n\r\nThen came a white upheaval at my side, and a voice said, with bitterness:\r\n\r\n"Will some gentleman be so good as to kick me behind?"\r\n\r\nIt was Ballou--at least it was a towzled snow image in a sitting posture,\r\nwith Ballou\'s voice.\r\n\r\nI rose up, and there in the gray dawn, not fifteen steps from us, were\r\nthe frame buildings of a stage station, and under a shed stood our still\r\nsaddled and bridled horses!\r\n\r\nAn arched snow-drift broke up, now, and Ollendorff emerged from it, and\r\nthe three of us sat and stared at the houses without speaking a word.\r\nWe really had nothing to say.  We were like the profane man who could not\r\n"do the subject justice," the whole situation was so painfully ridiculous\r\nand humiliating that words were tame and we did not know where to\r\ncommence anyhow.\r\n\r\nThe joy in our hearts at our deliverance was poisoned; well-nigh\r\ndissipated, indeed.  We presently began to grow pettish by degrees, and\r\nsullen; and then, angry at each other, angry at ourselves, angry at\r\neverything in general, we moodily dusted the snow from our clothing and\r\nin unsociable single file plowed our way to the horses, unsaddled them,\r\nand sought shelter in the station.\r\n\r\nI have scarcely exaggerated a detail of this curious and absurd\r\nadventure.  It occurred almost exactly as I have stated it.  We actually\r\nwent into camp in a snow-drift in a desert, at midnight in a storm,\r\nforlorn and hopeless, within fifteen steps of a comfortable inn.\r\n\r\nFor two hours we sat apart in the station and ruminated in disgust.\r\nThe mystery was gone, now, and it was plain enough why the horses had\r\ndeserted us.  Without a doubt they were under that shed a quarter of a\r\nminute after they had left us, and they must have overheard and enjoyed\r\nall our confessions and lamentations.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we felt better, and the zest of life soon came back.\r\nThe world looked bright again, and existence was as dear to us as ever.\r\nPresently an uneasiness came over me--grew upon me--assailed me without\r\nceasing.  Alas, my regeneration was not complete--I wanted to smoke!\r\nI resisted with all my strength, but the flesh was weak.  I wandered away\r\nalone and wrestled with myself an hour.  I recalled my promises of reform\r\nand preached to myself persuasively, upbraidingly, exhaustively.  But it\r\nwas all vain, I shortly found myself sneaking among the snow-drifts\r\nhunting for my pipe.  I discovered it after a considerable search, and\r\ncrept away to hide myself and enjoy it.  I remained behind the barn a\r\ngood while, asking myself how I would feel if my braver, stronger, truer\r\ncomrades should catch me in my degradation.  At last I lit the pipe, and\r\nno human being can feel meaner and baser than I did then.  I was ashamed\r\nof being in my own pitiful company.  Still dreading discovery, I felt\r\nthat perhaps the further side of the barn would be somewhat safer, and so\r\nI turned the corner.  As I turned the one corner, smoking, Ollendorff\r\nturned the other with his bottle to his lips, and between us sat\r\nunconscious Ballou deep in a game of "solitaire" with the old greasy\r\ncards!\r\n\r\nAbsurdity could go no farther.  We shook hands and agreed to say no more\r\nabout "reform" and "examples to the rising generation."\r\n\r\nThe station we were at was at the verge of the Twenty-six-Mile Desert.\r\nIf we had approached it half an hour earlier the night before, we must\r\nhave heard men shouting there and firing pistols; for they were expecting\r\nsome sheep drovers and their flocks and knew that they would infallibly\r\nget lost and wander out of reach of help unless guided by sounds.\r\n\r\nWhile we remained at the station, three of the drovers arrived, nearly\r\nexhausted with their wanderings, but two others of their party were never\r\nheard of afterward.\r\n\r\nWe reached Carson in due time, and took a rest.  This rest, together with\r\npreparations for the journey to Esmeralda, kept us there a week, and the\r\ndelay gave us the opportunity to be present at the trial of the great\r\nland-slide case of Hyde vs. Morgan--an episode which is famous in Nevada\r\nto this day.  After a word or two of necessary explanation, I will set\r\ndown the history of this singular affair just as it transpired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nThe mountains are very high and steep about Carson, Eagle and Washoe\r\nValleys--very high and very steep, and so when the snow gets to melting\r\noff fast in the Spring and the warm surface-earth begins to moisten and\r\nsoften, the disastrous land-slides commence.  The reader cannot know what\r\na land-slide is, unless he has lived in that country and seen the whole\r\nside of a mountain taken off some fine morning and deposited down in the\r\nvalley, leaving a vast, treeless, unsightly scar upon the mountain\'s\r\nfront to keep the circumstance fresh in his memory all the years that he\r\nmay go on living within seventy miles of that place.\r\n\r\nGeneral Buncombe was shipped out to Nevada in the invoice of Territorial\r\nofficers, to be United States Attorney.  He considered himself a lawyer\r\nof parts, and he very much wanted an opportunity to manifest it--partly\r\nfor the pure gratification of it and partly because his salary was\r\nTerritorially meagre (which is a strong expression).  Now the older\r\ncitizens of a new territory look down upon the rest of the world with a\r\ncalm, benevolent compassion, as long as it keeps out of the way--when it\r\ngets in the way they snub it.  Sometimes this latter takes the shape of a\r\npractical joke.\r\n\r\nOne morning Dick Hyde rode furiously up to General Buncombe\'s door in\r\nCarson city and rushed into his presence without stopping to tie his\r\nhorse.  He seemed much excited.  He told the General that he wanted him\r\nto conduct a suit for him and would pay him five hundred dollars if he\r\nachieved a victory.  And then, with violent gestures and a world of\r\nprofanity, he poured out his grief.  He said it was pretty well known\r\nthat for some years he had been farming (or ranching as the more\r\ncustomary term is) in Washoe District, and making a successful thing of\r\nit, and furthermore it was known that his ranch was situated just in the\r\nedge of the valley, and that Tom Morgan owned a ranch immediately above\r\nit on the mountain side.\r\n\r\nAnd now the trouble was, that one of those hated and dreaded land-slides\r\nhad come and slid Morgan\'s ranch, fences, cabins, cattle, barns and\r\neverything down on top of his ranch and exactly covered up every single\r\nvestige of his property, to a depth of about thirty-eight feet.  Morgan\r\nwas in possession and refused to vacate the premises--said he was\r\noccupying his own cabin and not interfering with anybody else\'s--and said\r\nthe cabin was standing on the same dirt and same ranch it had always\r\nstood on, and he would like to see anybody make him vacate.\r\n\r\n"And when I reminded him," said Hyde, weeping, "that it was on top of my\r\nranch and that he was trespassing, he had the infernal meanness to ask me\r\nwhy didn\'t I stay on my ranch and hold possession when I see him\r\na-coming!  Why didn\'t I stay on it, the blathering lunatic--by George,\r\nwhen I heard that racket and looked up that hill it was just like the\r\nwhole world was a-ripping and a-tearing down that mountain side\r\n--splinters, and cord-wood, thunder and lightning, hail and snow, odds and\r\nends of hay stacks, and awful clouds of dust!--trees going end over end\r\nin the air, rocks as big as a house jumping \'bout a thousand feet high\r\nand busting into ten million pieces, cattle turned inside out and\r\na-coming head on with their tails hanging out between their teeth!--and\r\nin the midst of all that wrack and destruction sot that cussed Morgan on\r\nhis gate-post, a-wondering why I didn\'t stay and hold possession!  Laws\r\nbless me, I just took one glimpse, General, and lit out\'n the county in\r\nthree jumps exactly.\r\n\r\n"But what grinds me is that that Morgan hangs on there and won\'t move\r\noff\'n that ranch--says it\'s his\'n and he\'s going to keep it--likes it\r\nbetter\'n he did when it was higher up the hill.  Mad!  Well, I\'ve been so\r\nmad for two days I couldn\'t find my way to town--been wandering around in\r\nthe brush in a starving condition--got anything here to drink, General?\r\nBut I\'m here now, and I\'m a-going to law.  You hear me!"\r\n\r\nNever in all the world, perhaps, were a man\'s feelings so outraged as\r\nwere the General\'s.  He said he had never heard of such high-handed\r\nconduct in all his life as this Morgan\'s.  And he said there was no use\r\nin going to law--Morgan had no shadow of right to remain where he was\r\n--nobody in the wide world would uphold him in it, and no lawyer would take\r\nhis case and no judge listen to it.  Hyde said that right there was where\r\nhe was mistaken--everybody in town sustained Morgan; Hal Brayton, a very\r\nsmart lawyer, had taken his case; the courts being in vacation, it was to\r\nbe tried before a referee, and ex-Governor Roop had already been\r\nappointed to that office and would open his court in a large public hall\r\nnear the hotel at two that afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe General was amazed.  He said he had suspected before that the people\r\nof that Territory were fools, and now he knew it.  But he said rest easy,\r\nrest easy and collect the witnesses, for the victory was just as certain\r\nas if the conflict were already over.  Hyde wiped away his tears and\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nAt two in the afternoon referee Roop\'s Court opened and Roop appeared\r\nthroned among his sheriffs, the witnesses, and spectators, and wearing\r\nupon his face a solemnity so awe-inspiring that some of his\r\nfellow-conspirators had misgivings that maybe he had not comprehended,\r\nafter all, that this was merely a joke.  An unearthly stillness\r\nprevailed, for at the slightest noise the judge uttered sternly the\r\ncommand:\r\n\r\n"Order in the Court!"\r\n\r\nAnd the sheriffs promptly echoed it.  Presently the General elbowed his\r\nway through the crowd of spectators, with his arms full of law-books, and\r\non his ears fell an order from the judge which was the first respectful\r\nrecognition of his high official dignity that had ever saluted them, and\r\nit trickled pleasantly through his whole system:\r\n\r\n"Way for the United States Attorney!"\r\n\r\nThe witnesses were called--legislators, high government officers,\r\nranchmen, miners, Indians, Chinamen, negroes.  Three fourths of them were\r\ncalled by the defendant Morgan, but no matter, their testimony invariably\r\nwent in favor of the plaintiff Hyde.  Each new witness only added new\r\ntestimony to the absurdity of a man\'s claiming to own another man\'s\r\nproperty because his farm had slid down on top of it.  Then the Morgan\r\nlawyers made their speeches, and seemed to make singularly weak ones\r\n--they did really nothing to help the Morgan cause.  And now the General,\r\nwith exultation in his face, got up and made an impassioned effort; he\r\npounded the table, he banged the law-books, he shouted, and roared, and\r\nhowled, he quoted from everything and everybody, poetry, sarcasm,\r\nstatistics, history, pathos, bathos, blasphemy, and wound up with a grand\r\nwar-whoop for free speech, freedom of the press, free schools, the\r\nGlorious Bird of America and the principles of eternal justice!\r\n[Applause.]\r\n\r\nWhen the General sat down, he did it with the conviction that if there\r\nwas anything in good strong testimony, a great speech and believing and\r\nadmiring countenances all around, Mr. Morgan\'s case was killed.\r\nEx-Governor Roop leant his head upon his hand for some minutes, thinking,\r\nand the still audience waited for his decision.  Then he got up and stood\r\nerect, with bended head, and thought again.  Then he walked the floor\r\nwith long, deliberate strides, his chin in his hand, and still the\r\naudience waited.  At last he returned to his throne, seated himself, and\r\nbegan impressively:\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, I feel the great responsibility that rests upon me this day.\r\nThis is no ordinary case.  On the contrary it is plain that it is the\r\nmost solemn and awful that ever man was called upon to decide.\r\nGentlemen, I have listened attentively to the evidence, and have\r\nperceived that the weight of it, the overwhelming weight of it, is in\r\nfavor of the plaintiff Hyde.  I have listened also to the remarks of\r\ncounsel, with high interest--and especially will I commend the masterly\r\nand irrefutable logic of the distinguished gentleman who represents the\r\nplaintiff.  But gentlemen, let us beware how we allow mere human\r\ntestimony, human ingenuity in argument and human ideas of equity, to\r\ninfluence us at a moment so solemn as this.  Gentlemen, it ill becomes\r\nus, worms as we are, to meddle with the decrees of Heaven.  It is plain\r\nto me that Heaven, in its inscrutable wisdom, has seen fit to move this\r\ndefendant\'s ranch for a purpose.  We are but creatures, and we must\r\nsubmit.  If Heaven has chosen to favor the defendant Morgan in this\r\nmarked and wonderful manner; and if Heaven, dissatisfied with the\r\nposition of the Morgan ranch upon the mountain side, has chosen to remove\r\nit to a position more eligible and more advantageous for its owner, it\r\nill becomes us, insects as we are, to question the legality of the act or\r\ninquire into the reasons that prompted it.  No--Heaven created the\r\nranches and it is Heaven\'s prerogative to rearrange them, to experiment\r\nwith them around at its pleasure.  It is for us to submit, without\r\nrepining.\r\n\r\n"I warn you that this thing which has happened is a thing with which the\r\nsacrilegious hands and brains and tongues of men must not meddle.\r\nGentlemen, it is the verdict of this court that the plaintiff, Richard\r\nHyde, has been deprived of his ranch by the visitation of God!  And from\r\nthis decision there is no appeal."\r\n\r\nBuncombe seized his cargo of law-books and plunged out of the court-room\r\nfrantic with indignation.  He pronounced Roop to be a miraculous fool, an\r\ninspired idiot.  In all good faith he returned at night and remonstrated\r\nwith Roop upon his extravagant decision, and implored him to walk the\r\nfloor and think for half an hour, and see if he could not figure out some\r\nsort of modification of the verdict.  Roop yielded at last and got up to\r\nwalk.  He walked two hours and a half, and at last his face lit up\r\nhappily and he told Buncombe it had occurred to him that the ranch\r\nunderneath the new Morgan ranch still belonged to Hyde, that his title to\r\nthe ground was just as good as it had ever been, and therefore he was of\r\nopinion that Hyde had a right to dig it out from under there and--\r\n\r\nThe General never waited to hear the end of it.  He was always an\r\nimpatient and irascible man, that way.  At the end of two months the fact\r\nthat he had been played upon with a joke had managed to bore itself, like\r\nanother Hoosac Tunnel, through the solid adamant of his understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nWhen we finally left for Esmeralda, horseback, we had an addition to the\r\ncompany in the person of Capt. John Nye, the Governor\'s brother.  He had\r\na good memory, and a tongue hung in the middle.  This is a combination\r\nwhich gives immortality to conversation.  Capt. John never suffered the\r\ntalk to flag or falter once during the hundred and twenty miles of the\r\njourney.  In addition to his conversational powers, he had one or two\r\nother endowments of a marked character.  One was a singular "handiness"\r\nabout doing anything and everything, from laying out a railroad or\r\norganizing a political party, down to sewing on buttons, shoeing a horse,\r\nor setting a broken leg, or a hen.  Another was a spirit of accommodation\r\nthat prompted him to take the needs, difficulties and perplexities of\r\nanybody and everybody upon his own shoulders at any and all times, and\r\ndispose of them with admirable facility and alacrity--hence he always\r\nmanaged to find vacant beds in crowded inns, and plenty to eat in the\r\nemptiest larders.  And finally, wherever he met a man, woman or child, in\r\ncamp, inn or desert, he either knew such parties personally or had been\r\nacquainted with a relative of the same.  Such another traveling comrade\r\nwas never seen before.  I cannot forbear giving a specimen of the way in\r\nwhich he overcame difficulties.  On the second day out, we arrived, very\r\ntired and hungry, at a poor little inn in the desert, and were told that\r\nthe house was full, no provisions on hand, and neither hay nor barley to\r\nspare for the horses--must move on.  The rest of us wanted to hurry on\r\nwhile it was yet light, but Capt. John insisted on stopping awhile.\r\nWe dismounted and entered.  There was no welcome for us on any face.\r\nCapt. John began his blandishments, and within twenty minutes he had\r\naccomplished the following things, viz.: found old acquaintances in three\r\nteamsters; discovered that he used to go to school with the landlord\'s\r\nmother; recognized his wife as a lady whose life he had saved once in\r\nCalifornia, by stopping her runaway horse; mended a child\'s broken toy\r\nand won the favor of its mother, a guest of the inn; helped the hostler\r\nbleed a horse, and prescribed for another horse that had the "heaves";\r\ntreated the entire party three times at the landlord\'s bar; produced a\r\nlater paper than anybody had seen for a week and sat himself down to read\r\nthe news to a deeply interested audience.  The result, summed up, was as\r\nfollows: The hostler found plenty of feed for our horses; we had a trout\r\nsupper, an exceedingly sociable time after it, good beds to sleep in, and\r\na surprising breakfast in the morning--and when we left, we left lamented\r\nby all!  Capt. John had some bad traits, but he had some uncommonly\r\nvaluable ones to offset them with.\r\n\r\nEsmeralda was in many respects another Humboldt, but in a little more\r\nforward state.  The claims we had been paying assessments on were\r\nentirely worthless, and we threw them away.  The principal one cropped\r\nout of the top of a knoll that was fourteen feet high, and the inspired\r\nBoard of Directors were running a tunnel under that knoll to strike the\r\nledge.  The tunnel would have to be seventy feet long, and would then\r\nstrike the ledge at the same dept that a shaft twelve feet deep would\r\nhave reached!  The Board were living on the "assessments."  [N.B.--This\r\nhint comes too late for the enlightenment of New York silver miners; they\r\nhave already learned all about this neat trick by experience.]  The Board\r\nhad no desire to strike the ledge, knowing that it was as barren of\r\nsilver as a curbstone.  This reminiscence calls to mind Jim Townsend\'s\r\ntunnel.  He had paid assessments on a mine called the "Daley" till he was\r\nwell-nigh penniless.  Finally an assessment was levied to run a tunnel\r\ntwo hundred and fifty feet on the Daley, and Townsend went up on the hill\r\nto look into matters.\r\n\r\nHe found the Daley cropping out of the apex of an exceedingly\r\nsharp-pointed peak, and a couple of men up there "facing" the proposed\r\ntunnel. Townsend made a calculation.  Then he said to the men:\r\n\r\n"So you have taken a contract to run a tunnel into this hill two hundred\r\nand fifty feet to strike this ledge?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Well, do you know that you have got one of the most expensive and\r\narduous undertakings before you that was ever conceived by man?"\r\n\r\n"Why no--how is that?"\r\n\r\n"Because this hill is only twenty-five feet through from side to side;\r\nand so you have got to build two hundred and twenty-five feet of your\r\ntunnel on trestle-work!"\r\n\r\nThe ways of silver mining Boards are exceedingly dark and sinuous.\r\n\r\nWe took up various claims, and commenced shafts and tunnels on them, but\r\nnever finished any of them.  We had to do a certain amount of work on\r\neach to "hold" it, else other parties could seize our property after the\r\nexpiration of ten days.  We were always hunting up new claims and doing a\r\nlittle work on them and then waiting for a buyer--who never came.  We\r\nnever found any ore that would yield more than fifty dollars a ton; and\r\nas the mills charged fifty dollars a ton for working ore and extracting\r\nthe silver, our pocket-money melted steadily away and none returned to\r\ntake its place.  We lived in a little cabin and cooked for ourselves; and\r\naltogether it was a hard life, though a hopeful one--for we never ceased\r\nto expect fortune and a customer to burst upon us some day.\r\n\r\nAt last, when flour reached a dollar a pound, and money could not be\r\nborrowed on the best security at less than eight per cent a month (I\r\nbeing without the security, too), I abandoned mining and went to milling.\r\nThat is to say, I went to work as a common laborer in a quartz mill, at\r\nten dollars a week and board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nI had already learned how hard and long and dismal a task it is to burrow\r\ndown into the bowels of the earth and get out the coveted ore; and now I\r\nlearned that the burrowing was only half the work; and that to get the\r\nsilver out of the ore was the dreary and laborious other half of it.\r\nWe had to turn out at six in the morning and keep at it till dark.\r\nThis mill was a six-stamp affair, driven by steam.  Six tall, upright\r\nrods of iron, as large as a man\'s ankle, and heavily shod with a mass of\r\niron and steel at their lower ends, were framed together like a gate, and\r\nthese rose and fell, one after the other, in a ponderous dance, in an\r\niron box called a "battery."  Each of these rods or stamps weighed six\r\nhundred pounds.  One of us stood by the battery all day long, breaking up\r\nmasses of silver-bearing rock with a sledge and shoveling it into the\r\nbattery.  The ceaseless dance of the stamps pulverized the rock to\r\npowder, and a stream of water that trickled into the battery turned it to\r\na creamy paste.  The minutest particles were driven through a fine wire\r\nscreen which fitted close around the battery, and were washed into great\r\ntubs warmed by super-heated steam--amalgamating pans, they are called.\r\nThe mass of pulp in the pans was kept constantly stirred up by revolving\r\n"mullers."  A quantity of quicksilver was kept always in the battery, and\r\nthis seized some of the liberated gold and silver particles and held on\r\nto them; quicksilver was shaken in a fine shower into the pans, also,\r\nabout every half hour, through a buckskin sack.  Quantities of coarse\r\nsalt and sulphate of copper were added, from time to time to assist the\r\namalgamation by destroying base metals which coated the gold and silver\r\nand would not let it unite with the quicksilver.\r\n\r\nAll these tiresome things we had to attend to constantly.  Streams of\r\ndirty water flowed always from the pans and were carried off in broad\r\nwooden troughs to the ravine.  One would not suppose that atoms of gold\r\nand silver would float on top of six inches of water, but they did; and\r\nin order to catch them, coarse blankets were laid in the troughs, and\r\nlittle obstructing "riffles" charged with quicksilver were placed here\r\nand there across the troughs also.  These riffles had to be cleaned and\r\nthe blankets washed out every evening, to get their precious\r\naccumulations--and after all this eternity of trouble one third of the\r\nsilver and gold in a ton of rock would find its way to the end of the\r\ntroughs in the ravine at last and have to be worked over again some day.\r\nThere is nothing so aggravating as silver milling.  There never was any\r\nidle time in that mill.  There was always something to do.  It is a pity\r\nthat Adam could not have gone straight out of Eden into a quartz mill, in\r\norder to understand the full force of his doom to "earn his bread by the\r\nsweat of his brow."  Every now and then, during the day, we had to scoop\r\nsome pulp out of the pans, and tediously "wash" it in a horn spoon--wash\r\nit little by little over the edge till at last nothing was left but some\r\nlittle dull globules of quicksilver in the bottom.  If they were soft and\r\nyielding, the pan needed some salt or some sulphate of copper or some\r\nother chemical rubbish to assist digestion; if they were crisp to the\r\ntouch and would retain a dint, they were freighted with all the silver\r\nand gold they could seize and hold, and consequently the pan needed a\r\nfresh charge of quicksilver.  When there was nothing else to do, one\r\ncould always "screen tailings."  That is to say, he could shovel up the\r\ndried sand that had washed down to the ravine through the troughs and\r\ndash it against an upright wire screen to free it from pebbles and\r\nprepare it for working over.\r\n\r\nThe process of amalgamation differed in the various mills, and this\r\nincluded changes in style of pans and other machinery, and a great\r\ndiversity of opinion existed as to the best in use, but none of the\r\nmethods employed, involved the principle of milling ore without\r\n"screening the tailings."  Of all recreations in the world, screening\r\ntailings on a hot day, with a long-handled shovel, is the most\r\nundesirable.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the week the machinery was stopped and we "cleaned up."\r\nThat is to say, we got the pulp out of the pans and batteries, and washed\r\nthe mud patiently away till nothing was left but the long accumulating\r\nmass of quicksilver, with its imprisoned treasures.  This we made into\r\nheavy, compact snow-balls, and piled them up in a bright, luxurious heap\r\nfor inspection.  Making these snow-balls cost me a fine gold ring--that\r\nand ignorance together; for the quicksilver invaded the ring with the\r\nsame facility with which water saturates a sponge--separated its\r\nparticles and the ring crumbled to pieces.\r\n\r\nWe put our pile of quicksilver balls into an iron retort that had a pipe\r\nleading from it to a pail of water, and then applied a roasting heat.\r\nThe quicksilver turned to vapor, escaped through the pipe into the pail,\r\nand the water turned it into good wholesome quicksilver again.\r\nQuicksilver is very costly, and they never waste it.  On opening the\r\nretort, there was our week\'s work--a lump of pure white, frosty looking\r\nsilver, twice as large as a man\'s head.  Perhaps a fifth of the mass was\r\ngold, but the color of it did not show--would not have shown if two\r\nthirds of it had been gold.  We melted it up and made a solid brick of it\r\nby pouring it into an iron brick-mould.\r\n\r\nBy such a tedious and laborious process were silver bricks obtained.\r\nThis mill was but one of many others in operation at the time.  The first\r\none in Nevada was built at Egan Canyon and was a small insignificant\r\naffair and compared most unfavorably with some of the immense\r\nestablishments afterwards located at Virginia City and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nFrom our bricks a little corner was chipped off for the "fire-assay"--a\r\nmethod used to determine the proportions of gold, silver and base metals\r\nin the mass.  This is an interesting process.  The chip is hammered out\r\nas thin as paper and weighed on scales so fine and sensitive that if you\r\nweigh a two-inch scrap of paper on them and then write your name on the\r\npaper with a course, soft pencil and weigh it again, the scales will take\r\nmarked notice of the addition.\r\n\r\nThen a little lead (also weighed) is rolled up with the flake of silver\r\nand the two are melted at a great heat in a small vessel called a cupel,\r\nmade by compressing bone ashes into a cup-shape in a steel mold.  The\r\nbase metals oxydize and are absorbed with the lead into the pores of the\r\ncupel.  A button or globule of perfectly pure gold and silver is left\r\nbehind, and by weighing it and noting the loss, the assayer knows the\r\nproportion of base metal the brick contains.  He has to separate the gold\r\nfrom the silver now.  The button is hammered out flat and thin, put in\r\nthe furnace and kept some time at a red heat; after cooling it off it is\r\nrolled up like a quill and heated in a glass vessel containing nitric\r\nacid; the acid dissolves the silver and leaves the gold pure and ready to\r\nbe weighed on its own merits.  Then salt water is poured into the vessel\r\ncontaining the dissolved silver and the silver returns to palpable form\r\nagain and sinks to the bottom.  Nothing now remains but to weigh it; then\r\nthe proportions of the several metals contained in the brick are known,\r\nand the assayer stamps the value of the brick upon its surface.\r\n\r\nThe sagacious reader will know now, without being told, that the\r\nspeculative miner, in getting a "fire-assay" made of a piece of rock from\r\nhis mine (to help him sell the same), was not in the habit of picking out\r\nthe least valuable fragment of rock on his dump-pile, but quite the\r\ncontrary.  I have seen men hunt over a pile of nearly worthless quartz\r\nfor an hour, and at last find a little piece as large as a filbert, which\r\nwas rich in gold and silver--and this was reserved for a fire-assay!  Of\r\ncourse the fire-assay would demonstrate that a ton of such rock would\r\nyield hundreds of dollars--and on such assays many an utterly worthless\r\nmine was sold.\r\n\r\nAssaying was a good business, and so some men engaged in it,\r\noccasionally, who were not strictly scientific and capable.  One assayer\r\ngot such rich results out of all specimens brought to him that in time he\r\nacquired almost a monopoly of the business.  But like all men who achieve\r\nsuccess, he became an object of envy and suspicion.  The other assayers\r\nentered into a conspiracy against him, and let some prominent citizens\r\ninto the secret in order to show that they meant fairly.  Then they broke\r\na little fragment off a carpenter\'s grindstone and got a stranger to take\r\nit to the popular scientist and get it assayed.  In the course of an hour\r\nthe result came--whereby it appeared that a ton of that rock would yield\r\n$1,184.40 in silver and $366.36 in gold!\r\n\r\nDue publication of the whole matter was made in the paper, and the\r\npopular assayer left town "between two days."\r\n\r\nI will remark, in passing, that I only remained in the milling business\r\none week.  I told my employer I could not stay longer without an advance\r\nin my wages; that I liked quartz milling, indeed was infatuated with it;\r\nthat I had never before grown so tenderly attached to an occupation in so\r\nshort a time; that nothing, it seemed to me, gave such scope to\r\nintellectual activity as feeding a battery and screening tailings, and\r\nnothing so stimulated the moral attributes as retorting bullion and\r\nwashing blankets--still, I felt constrained to ask an increase of salary.\r\nHe said he was paying me ten dollars a week, and thought it a good round\r\nsum.  How much did I want?\r\n\r\nI said about four hundred thousand dollars a month, and board, was about\r\nall I could reasonably ask, considering the hard times.\r\n\r\nI was ordered off the premises!  And yet, when I look back to those days\r\nand call to mind the exceeding hardness of the labor I performed in that\r\nmill, I only regret that I did not ask him seven hundred thousand.\r\n\r\nShortly after this I began to grow crazy, along with the rest of the\r\npopulation, about the mysterious and wonderful "cement mine," and to make\r\npreparations to take advantage of any opportunity that might offer to go\r\nand help hunt for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nIt was somewhere in the neighborhood of Mono Lake that the marvellous\r\nWhiteman cement mine was supposed to lie.  Every now and then it would be\r\nreported that Mr. W. had passed stealthily through Esmeralda at dead of\r\nnight, in disguise, and then we would have a wild excitement--because he\r\nmust be steering for his secret mine, and now was the time to follow him.\r\nIn less than three hours after daylight all the horses and mules and\r\ndonkeys in the vicinity would be bought, hired or stolen, and half the\r\ncommunity would be off for the mountains, following in the wake of\r\nWhiteman.  But W. would drift about through the mountain gorges for days\r\ntogether, in a purposeless sort of way, until the provisions of the\r\nminers ran out, and they would have to go back home.  I have known it\r\nreported at eleven at night, in a large mining camp, that Whiteman had\r\njust passed through, and in two hours the streets, so quiet before, would\r\nbe swarming with men and animals.  Every individual would be trying to be\r\nvery secret, but yet venturing to whisper to just one neighbor that W.\r\nhad passed through.  And long before daylight--this in the dead of\r\nWinter--the stampede would be complete, the camp deserted, and the whole\r\npopulation gone chasing after W.\r\n\r\nThe tradition was that in the early immigration, more than twenty years\r\nago, three young Germans, brothers, who had survived an Indian massacre\r\non the Plains, wandered on foot through the deserts, avoiding all trails\r\nand roads, and simply holding a westerly direction and hoping to find\r\nCalifornia before they starved, or died of fatigue.  And in a gorge in\r\nthe mountains they sat down to rest one day, when one of them noticed a\r\ncurious vein of cement running along the ground, shot full of lumps of\r\ndull yellow metal.  They saw that it was gold, and that here was a\r\nfortune to be acquired in a single day.  The vein was about as wide as a\r\ncurbstone, and fully two thirds of it was pure gold.  Every pound of the\r\nwonderful cement was worth well-nigh $200.\r\n\r\nEach of the brothers loaded himself with about twenty-five pounds of it,\r\nand then they covered up all traces of the vein, made a rude drawing of\r\nthe locality and the principal landmarks in the vicinity, and started\r\nwestward again.  But troubles thickened about them.  In their wanderings\r\none brother fell and broke his leg, and the others were obliged to go on\r\nand leave him to die in the wilderness.  Another, worn out and starving,\r\ngave up by and by, and laid down to die, but after two or three weeks of\r\nincredible hardships, the third reached the settlements of California\r\nexhausted, sick, and his mind deranged by his sufferings.  He had thrown\r\naway all his cement but a few fragments, but these were sufficient to set\r\neverybody wild with excitement.  However, he had had enough of the cement\r\ncountry, and nothing could induce him to lead a party thither.  He was\r\nentirely content to work on a farm for wages.  But he gave Whiteman his\r\nmap, and described the cement region as well as he could and thus\r\ntransferred the curse to that gentleman--for when I had my one accidental\r\nglimpse of Mr. W. in Esmeralda he had been hunting for the lost mine, in\r\nhunger and thirst, poverty and sickness, for twelve or thirteen years.\r\nSome people believed he had found it, but most people believed he had\r\nnot.  I saw a piece of cement as large as my fist which was said to have\r\nbeen given to Whiteman by the young German, and it was of a seductive\r\nnature.  Lumps of virgin gold were as thick in it as raisins in a slice\r\nof fruit cake.  The privilege of working such a mine one week would be\r\nsufficient for a man of reasonable desires.\r\n\r\nA new partner of ours, a Mr. Higbie, knew Whiteman well by sight, and a\r\nfriend of ours, a Mr. Van Dorn, was well acquainted with him, and not\r\nonly that, but had Whiteman\'s promise that he should have a private hint\r\nin time to enable him to join the next cement expedition.  Van Dorn had\r\npromised to extend the hint to us.  One evening Higbie came in greatly\r\nexcited, and said he felt certain he had recognized Whiteman, up town,\r\ndisguised and in a pretended state of intoxication.  In a little while\r\nVan Dorn arrived and confirmed the news; and so we gathered in our cabin\r\nand with heads close together arranged our plans in impressive whispers.\r\n\r\nWe were to leave town quietly, after midnight, in two or three small\r\nparties, so as not to attract attention, and meet at dawn on the "divide"\r\noverlooking Mono Lake, eight or nine miles distant.  We were to make no\r\nnoise after starting, and not speak above a whisper under any\r\ncircumstances.  It was believed that for once Whiteman\'s presence was\r\nunknown in the town and his expedition unsuspected.  Our conclave broke\r\nup at nine o\'clock, and we set about our preparation diligently and with\r\nprofound secrecy.  At eleven o\'clock we saddled our horses, hitched them\r\nwith their long riatas (or lassos), and then brought out a side of bacon,\r\na sack of beans, a small sack of coffee, some sugar, a hundred pounds of\r\nflour in sacks, some tin cups and a coffee pot, frying pan and some few\r\nother necessary articles.  All these things were "packed" on the back of\r\na led horse--and whoever has not been taught, by a Spanish adept, to pack\r\nan animal, let him never hope to do the thing by natural smartness.  That\r\nis impossible.  Higbie had had some experience, but was not perfect.  He\r\nput on the pack saddle (a thing like a saw-buck), piled the property on\r\nit and then wound a rope all over and about it and under it, "every which\r\nway," taking a hitch in it every now and then, and occasionally surging\r\nback on it till the horse\'s sides sunk in and he gasped for breath--but\r\nevery time the lashings grew tight in one place they loosened in another.\r\nWe never did get the load tight all over, but we got it so that it would\r\ndo, after a fashion, and then we started, in single file, close order,\r\nand without a word.  It was a dark night.  We kept the middle of the\r\nroad, and proceeded in a slow walk past the rows of cabins, and whenever\r\na miner came to his door I trembled for fear the light would shine on us\r\nan excite curiosity.  But nothing happened.  We began the long winding\r\nascent of the canyon, toward the "divide," and presently the cabins began\r\nto grow infrequent, and the intervals between them wider and wider, and\r\nthen I began to breathe tolerably freely and feel less like a thief and a\r\nmurderer.  I was in the rear, leading the pack horse.  As the ascent grew\r\nsteeper he grew proportionately less satisfied with his cargo, and began\r\nto pull back on his riata occasionally and delay progress.  My comrades\r\nwere passing out of sight in the gloom.  I was getting anxious.  I coaxed\r\nand bullied the pack horse till I presently got him into a trot, and then\r\nthe tin cups and pans strung about his person frightened him and he ran.\r\nHis riata was wound around the pummel of my saddle, and so, as he went by\r\nhe dragged me from my horse and the two animals traveled briskly on\r\nwithout me.  But I was not alone--the loosened cargo tumbled overboard\r\nfrom the pack horse and fell close to me.  It was abreast of almost the\r\nlast cabin.\r\n\r\nA miner came out and said:\r\n\r\n"Hello!"\r\n\r\nI was thirty steps from him, and knew he could not see me, it was so very\r\ndark in the shadow of the mountain.  So I lay still.  Another head\r\nappeared in the light of the cabin door, and presently the two men walked\r\ntoward me.  They stopped within ten steps of me, and one said:\r\n\r\n"Sh!  Listen."\r\n\r\nI could not have been in a more distressed state if I had been escaping\r\njustice with a price on my head.  Then the miners appeared to sit down on\r\na boulder, though I could not see them distinctly enough to be very sure\r\nwhat they did.  One said:\r\n\r\n"I heard a noise, as plain as I ever heard anything.  It seemed to be\r\nabout there--"\r\n\r\nA stone whizzed by my head.  I flattened myself out in the dust like a\r\npostage stamp, and thought to myself if he mended his aim ever so little\r\nhe would probably hear another noise.  In my heart, now, I execrated\r\nsecret expeditions.  I promised myself that this should be my last,\r\nthough the Sierras were ribbed with cement veins.  Then one of the men\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what!  Welch knew what he was talking about when he said\r\nhe saw Whiteman to-day.  I heard horses--that was the noise.  I am going\r\ndown to Welch\'s, right away."\r\n\r\nThey left and I was glad.  I did not care whither they went, so they\r\nwent.  I was willing they should visit Welch, and the sooner the better.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they closed their cabin door my comrades emerged from the\r\ngloom; they had caught the horses and were waiting for a clear coast\r\nagain.  We remounted the cargo on the pack horse and got under way, and\r\nas day broke we reached the "divide" and joined Van Dorn.  Then we\r\njourneyed down into the valley of the Lake, and feeling secure, we halted\r\nto cook breakfast, for we were tired and sleepy and hungry.  Three hours\r\nlater the rest of the population filed over the "divide" in a long\r\nprocession, and drifted off out of sight around the borders of the Lake!\r\n\r\nWhether or not my accident had produced this result we never knew, but at\r\nleast one thing was certain--the secret was out and Whiteman would not\r\nenter upon a search for the cement mine this time.  We were filled with\r\nchagrin.\r\n\r\nWe held a council and decided to make the best of our misfortune and\r\nenjoy a week\'s holiday on the borders of the curious Lake.  Mono, it is\r\nsometimes called, and sometimes the "Dead Sea of California."  It is one\r\nof the strangest freaks of Nature to be found in any land, but it is\r\nhardly ever mentioned in print and very seldom visited, because it lies\r\naway off the usual routes of travel and besides is so difficult to get at\r\nthat only men content to endure the roughest life will consent to take\r\nupon themselves the discomforts of such a trip.  On the morning of our\r\nsecond day, we traveled around to a remote and particularly wild spot on\r\nthe borders of the Lake, where a stream of fresh, ice-cold water entered\r\nit from the mountain side, and then we went regularly into camp.  We\r\nhired a large boat and two shot-guns from a lonely ranchman who lived\r\nsome ten miles further on, and made ready for comfort and recreation.\r\nWe soon got thoroughly acquainted with the Lake and all its\r\npeculiarities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nMono Lake lies in a lifeless, treeless, hideous desert, eight thousand\r\nfeet above the level of the sea, and is guarded by mountains two thousand\r\nfeet higher, whose summits are always clothed in clouds.  This solemn,\r\nsilent, sail-less sea--this lonely tenant of the loneliest spot on earth\r\n--is little graced with the picturesque.  It is an unpretending expanse\r\nof grayish water, about a hundred miles in circumference, with two\r\nislands in its centre, mere upheavals of rent and scorched and blistered\r\nlava, snowed over with gray banks and drifts of pumice-stone and ashes,\r\nthe winding sheet of the dead volcano, whose vast crater the lake has\r\nseized upon and occupied.\r\n\r\nThe lake is two hundred feet deep, and its sluggish waters are so strong\r\nwith alkali that if you only dip the most hopelessly soiled garment into\r\nthem once or twice, and wring it out, it will be found as clean as if it\r\nhad been through the ablest of washerwomen\'s hands.  While we camped\r\nthere our laundry work was easy.  We tied the week\'s washing astern of\r\nour boat, and sailed a quarter of a mile, and the job was complete, all\r\nto the wringing out.  If we threw the water on our heads and gave them a\r\nrub or so, the white lather would pile up three inches high.  This water\r\nis not good for bruised places and abrasions of the skin.  We had a\r\nvaluable dog.  He had raw places on him.  He had more raw places on him\r\nthan sound ones.  He was the rawest dog I almost ever saw.  He jumped\r\noverboard one day to get away from the flies.  But it was bad judgment.\r\nIn his condition, it would have been just as comfortable to jump into the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nThe alkali water nipped him in all the raw places simultaneously, and he\r\nstruck out for the shore with considerable interest.  He yelped and\r\nbarked and howled as he went--and by the time he got to the shore there\r\nwas no bark to him--for he had barked the bark all out of his inside, and\r\nthe alkali water had cleaned the bark all off his outside, and he\r\nprobably wished he had never embarked in any such enterprise.  He ran\r\nround and round in a circle, and pawed  the earth and clawed the air, and\r\nthrew double somersaults, sometimes backward and sometimes forward, in\r\nthe most extraordinary manner.  He was not a demonstrative dog, as a\r\ngeneral thing, but rather of a grave and serious turn of mind, and I\r\nnever saw him take so much interest in anything before.  He finally\r\nstruck out over the mountains, at a gait which we estimated at about two\r\nhundred and fifty miles an hour, and he is going yet.  This was about\r\nnine years ago.  We look for what is left of him along here every day.\r\n\r\nA white man cannot drink the water of Mono Lake, for it is nearly pure\r\nlye.  It is said that the Indians in the vicinity drink it sometimes,\r\nthough.  It is not improbable, for they are among the purest liars I ever\r\nsaw.  [There will be no additional charge for this joke, except to\r\nparties requiring an explanation of it.  This joke has received high\r\ncommendation from some of the ablest minds of the age.]\r\n\r\nThere are no fish in Mono Lake--no frogs, no snakes, no polliwigs\r\n--nothing, in fact, that goes to make life desirable.  Millions of wild\r\nducks and sea-gulls swim about the surface, but no living thing exists\r\nunder the surface, except a white feathery sort of worm, one half an inch\r\nlong, which looks like a bit of white thread frayed out at the sides.  If\r\nyou dip up a gallon of water, you will get about fifteen thousand of\r\nthese.  They give to the water a sort of grayish-white appearance.  Then\r\nthere is a fly, which looks something like our house fly.  These settle\r\non the beach to eat the worms that wash ashore--and any time, you can see\r\nthere a belt of flies an inch deep and six feet wide, and this belt\r\nextends clear around the lake--a belt of flies one hundred miles long.\r\nIf you throw a stone among them, they swarm up so thick that they look\r\ndense, like a cloud.  You can hold them under water as long as you\r\nplease--they do not mind it--they are only proud of it.  When you let\r\nthem go, they pop up to the surface as dry as a patent office report, and\r\nwalk off as unconcernedly as if they had been educated especially with a\r\nview to affording instructive entertainment to man in that particular\r\nway.  Providence leaves nothing to go by chance.  All things have their\r\nuses and their part and proper place in Nature\'s economy: the ducks eat\r\nthe flies--the flies eat the worms--the Indians eat all three--the wild\r\ncats eat the Indians--the white folks eat the wild cats--and thus all\r\nthings are lovely.\r\n\r\nMono Lake is a hundred miles in a straight line from the ocean--and\r\nbetween it and the ocean are one or two ranges of mountains--yet\r\nthousands of sea-gulls go there every season to lay their eggs and rear\r\ntheir young.  One would as soon expect to find sea-gulls in Kansas.\r\nAnd in this connection let us observe another instance of Nature\'s\r\nwisdom.  The islands in the lake being merely huge masses of lava, coated\r\nover with ashes and pumice-stone, and utterly innocent of vegetation or\r\nanything that would burn; and sea-gull\'s eggs being entirely useless to\r\nanybody unless they be cooked, Nature has provided an unfailing spring of\r\nboiling water on the largest island, and you can put your eggs in there,\r\nand in four minutes you can boil them as hard as any statement I have\r\nmade during the past fifteen years.  Within ten feet of the boiling\r\nspring is a spring of pure cold water, sweet and wholesome.\r\n\r\nSo, in that island you get your board and washing free of charge--and if\r\nnature had gone further and furnished a nice American hotel clerk who was\r\ncrusty and disobliging, and didn\'t know anything about the time tables,\r\nor the railroad routes--or--anything--and was proud of it--I would not\r\nwish for a more desirable boarding-house.\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen little mountain brooks flow into Mono Lake, but not a stream\r\nof any kind flows out of it.  It neither rises nor falls, apparently, and\r\nwhat it does with its surplus water is a dark and bloody mystery.\r\n\r\nThere are only two seasons in the region round about Mono Lake--and these\r\nare, the breaking up of one Winter and the beginning of the next.  More\r\nthan once (in Esmeralda) I have seen a perfectly blistering morning open\r\nup with the thermometer at ninety degrees at eight o\'clock, and seen the\r\nsnow fall fourteen inches deep and that same identical thermometer go\r\ndown to forty-four degrees under shelter, before nine o\'clock at night.\r\nUnder favorable circumstances it snows at least once in every single\r\nmonth in the year, in the little town of Mono.  So uncertain is the\r\nclimate in Summer that a lady who goes out visiting cannot hope to be\r\nprepared for all emergencies unless she takes her fan under one arm and\r\nher snow shoes under the other.  When they have a Fourth of July\r\nprocession it generally snows on them, and they do say that as a general\r\nthing when a man calls for a brandy toddy there, the bar keeper chops it\r\noff with a hatchet and wraps it up in a paper, like maple sugar.  And it\r\nis further reported that the old soakers haven\'t any teeth--wore them out\r\neating gin cocktails and brandy punches.  I do not endorse that\r\nstatement--I simply give it for what it is worth--and it is worth--well,\r\nI should say, millions, to any man who can believe it without straining\r\nhimself.  But I do endorse the snow on the Fourth of July--because I know\r\nthat to be true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nAbout seven o\'clock one blistering hot morning--for it was now dead\r\nsummer time--Higbie and I took the boat and started on a voyage of\r\ndiscovery to the two islands.  We had often longed to do this, but had\r\nbeen deterred by the fear of storms; for they were frequent, and severe\r\nenough to capsize an ordinary row-boat like ours without great\r\ndifficulty--and once capsized, death would ensue in spite of the bravest\r\nswimming, for that venomous water would eat a man\'s eyes out like fire,\r\nand burn him out inside, too, if he shipped a sea.  It was called twelve\r\nmiles, straight out to the islands--a long pull and a warm one--but the\r\nmorning was so quiet and sunny, and the lake so smooth and glassy and\r\ndead, that we could not resist the temptation.  So we filled two large\r\ntin canteens with water (since we were not acquainted with the locality\r\nof the spring said to exist on the large island), and started.  Higbie\'s\r\nbrawny muscles gave the boat good speed, but by the time we reached our\r\ndestination we judged that we had pulled nearer fifteen miles than\r\ntwelve.\r\n\r\nWe landed on the big island and went ashore.  We tried the water in the\r\ncanteens, now, and found that the sun had spoiled it; it was so brackish\r\nthat we could not drink it; so we poured it out and began a search for\r\nthe spring--for thirst augments fast as soon as it is apparent that one\r\nhas no means at hand of quenching it.  The island was a long, moderately\r\nhigh hill of ashes--nothing but gray ashes and pumice-stone, in which we\r\nsunk to our knees at every step--and all around the top was a forbidding\r\nwall of scorched and blasted rocks.  When we reached the top and got\r\nwithin the wall, we found simply a shallow, far-reaching basin, carpeted\r\nwith ashes, and here and there a patch of fine sand.  In places,\r\npicturesque jets of steam shot up out of crevices, giving evidence that\r\nalthough this ancient crater had gone out of active business, there was\r\nstill some fire left in its furnaces.  Close to one of these jets of\r\nsteam stood the only tree on the island--a small pine of most graceful\r\nshape and most faultless symmetry; its color was a brilliant green, for\r\nthe steam drifted unceasingly through its branches and kept them always\r\nmoist.  It contrasted strangely enough, did this vigorous and beautiful\r\noutcast, with its dead and dismal surroundings.  It was like a cheerful\r\nspirit in a mourning household.\r\n\r\nWe hunted for the spring everywhere, traversing the full length of the\r\nisland (two or three miles), and crossing it twice--climbing ash-hills\r\npatiently, and then sliding down the other side in a sitting posture,\r\nplowing up smothering volumes of gray dust.  But we found nothing but\r\nsolitude, ashes and a heart-breaking silence.  Finally we noticed that\r\nthe wind had risen, and we forgot our thirst in a solicitude of greater\r\nimportance; for, the lake being quiet, we had not taken pains about\r\nsecuring the boat.  We hurried back to a point overlooking our landing\r\nplace, and then--but mere words cannot describe our dismay--the boat was\r\ngone!  The chances were that there was not another boat on the entire\r\nlake.  The situation was not comfortable--in truth, to speak plainly, it\r\nwas frightful.  We were prisoners on a desolate island, in aggravating\r\nproximity to friends who were for the present helpless to aid us; and\r\nwhat was still more uncomfortable was the reflection that we had neither\r\nfood nor water.  But presently we sighted the boat.  It was drifting\r\nalong, leisurely, about fifty yards from shore, tossing in a foamy sea.\r\nIt drifted, and continued to drift, but at the same safe distance from\r\nland, and we walked along abreast it and waited for fortune to favor us.\r\nAt the end of an hour it approached a jutting cape, and Higbie ran ahead\r\nand posted himself on the utmost verge and prepared for the assault.  If\r\nwe failed there, there was no hope for us.  It was driving gradually\r\nshoreward all the time, now; but whether it was driving fast enough to\r\nmake the connection or not was the momentous question.  When it got\r\nwithin thirty steps of Higbie I was so excited that I fancied I could\r\nhear my own heart beat.  When, a little later, it dragged slowly along\r\nand seemed about to go by, only one little yard out of reach, it seemed\r\nas if my heart stood still; and when it was exactly abreast him and began\r\nto widen away, and he still standing like a watching statue, I knew my\r\nheart did stop.  But when he gave a great spring, the next instant, and\r\nlit fairly in the stern, I discharged a war-whoop that woke the\r\nsolitudes!\r\n\r\nBut it dulled my enthusiasm, presently, when he told me he had not been\r\ncaring whether the boat came within jumping distance or not, so that it\r\npassed within eight or ten yards of him, for he had made up his mind to\r\nshut his eyes and mouth and swim that trifling distance.  Imbecile that I\r\nwas, I had not thought of that.  It was only a long swim that could be\r\nfatal.\r\n\r\nThe sea was running high and the storm increasing.  It was growing late,\r\ntoo--three or four in the afternoon.  Whether to venture toward the\r\nmainland or not, was a question of some moment.  But we were so\r\ndistressed by thirst that we decide to try it, and so Higbie fell to work\r\nand I took the steering-oar.  When we had pulled a mile, laboriously,\r\nwe were evidently in serious peril, for the storm had greatly augmented;\r\nthe billows ran very high and were capped with foaming crests,\r\nthe heavens were hung with black, and the wind blew with great fury.\r\nWe would have gone back, now, but we did not dare to turn the boat\r\naround, because as soon as she got in the trough of the sea she would\r\nupset, of course.  Our only hope lay in keeping her head-on to the seas.\r\nIt was hard work to do this, she plunged so, and so beat and belabored\r\nthe billows with her rising and falling bows.  Now and then one of\r\nHigbie\'s oars would trip on the top of a wave, and the other one would\r\nsnatch the boat half around in spite of my cumbersome steering apparatus.\r\nWe were drenched by the sprays constantly, and the boat occasionally\r\nshipped water.  By and by, powerful as my comrade was, his great\r\nexertions began to tell on him, and he was anxious that I should change\r\nplaces with him till he could rest a little.  But I told him this was\r\nimpossible; for if the steering oar were dropped a moment while we\r\nchanged, the boat would slue around into the trough of the sea, capsize,\r\nand in less than five minutes we would have a hundred gallons of\r\nsoap-suds in us and be eaten up so quickly that we could not even be\r\npresent at our own inquest.\r\n\r\nBut things cannot last always.  Just as the darkness shut down we came\r\nbooming into port, head on.  Higbie dropped his oars to hurrah--I dropped\r\nmine to help--the sea gave the boat a twist, and over she went!\r\n\r\nThe agony that alkali water inflicts on bruises, chafes and blistered\r\nhands, is unspeakable, and nothing but greasing all over will modify it\r\n--but we ate, drank and slept well, that night, notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the peculiarities of Mono Lake, I ought to have mentioned\r\nthat at intervals all around its shores stand picturesque turret-looking\r\nmasses and clusters of a whitish, coarse-grained rock that resembles\r\ninferior mortar dried hard; and if one breaks off fragments of this rock\r\nhe will find perfectly shaped and thoroughly petrified gulls\' eggs deeply\r\nimbedded in the mass.  How did they get there?  I simply state the fact\r\n--for it is a fact--and leave the geological reader to crack the nut at his\r\nleisure and solve the problem after his own fashion.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a week we adjourned to the Sierras on a fishing excursion,\r\nand spent several days in camp under snowy Castle Peak, and fished\r\nsuccessfully for trout in a bright, miniature lake whose surface was\r\nbetween ten and eleven thousand feet above the level of the sea; cooling\r\nourselves during the hot August noons by sitting on snow banks ten feet\r\ndeep, under whose sheltering edges fine grass and dainty flowers\r\nflourished luxuriously; and at night entertaining ourselves by almost\r\nfreezing to death.  Then we returned to Mono Lake, and finding that the\r\ncement excitement was over for the present, packed up and went back to\r\nEsmeralda.  Mr. Ballou reconnoitred awhile, and not liking the prospect,\r\nset out alone for Humboldt.\r\n\r\nAbout this time occurred a little incident which has always had a sort of\r\ninterest to me, from the fact that it came so near "instigating" my\r\nfuneral.  At a time when an Indian attack had been expected, the citizens\r\nhid their gunpowder where it would be safe and yet convenient to hand\r\nwhen wanted.  A neighbor of ours hid six cans of rifle powder in the\r\nbake-oven of an old discarded cooking stove which stood on the open\r\nground near a frame out-house or shed, and from and after that day never\r\nthought of it again.  We hired a half-tamed Indian to do some washing for\r\nus, and he took up quarters under the shed with his tub.  The ancient\r\nstove reposed within six feet of him, and before his face.  Finally it\r\noccurred to him that hot water would be better than cold, and he went out\r\nand fired up under that forgotten powder magazine and set on a kettle of\r\nwater.  Then he returned to his tub.\r\n\r\nI entered the shed presently and threw down some more clothes, and was\r\nabout to speak to him when the stove blew up with a prodigious crash, and\r\ndisappeared, leaving not a splinter behind.  Fragments of it fell in the\r\nstreets full two hundred yards away.  Nearly a third of the shed roof\r\nover our heads was destroyed, and one of the stove lids, after cutting a\r\nsmall stanchion half in two in front of the Indian, whizzed between us\r\nand drove partly through the weather-boarding beyond.  I was as white as\r\na sheet and as weak as a kitten and speechless.  But the Indian betrayed\r\nno trepidation, no distress, not even discomfort.  He simply stopped\r\nwashing, leaned forward and surveyed the clean, blank ground a moment,\r\nand then remarked:\r\n\r\n"Mph!  Dam stove heap gone!"--and resumed his scrubbing as placidly as if\r\nit were an entirely customary thing for a stove to do.  I will explain,\r\nthat "heap" is "Injun-English" for "very much."  The reader will perceive\r\nthe exhaustive expressiveness of it in the present instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\nI now come to a curious episode--the most curious, I think, that had yet\r\naccented my slothful, valueless, heedless career.  Out of a hillside\r\ntoward the upper end of the town, projected a wall of reddish looking\r\nquartz-croppings, the exposed comb of a silver-bearing ledge that\r\nextended deep down into the earth, of course.  It was owned by a company\r\nentitled the "Wide West."  There was a shaft sixty or seventy feet deep\r\non the under side of the croppings, and everybody was acquainted with the\r\nrock that came from it--and tolerably rich rock it was, too, but nothing\r\nextraordinary.  I will remark here, that although to the inexperienced\r\nstranger all the quartz of a particular "district" looks about alike, an\r\nold resident of the camp can take a glance at a mixed pile of rock,\r\nseparate the fragments and tell you which mine each came from, as easily\r\nas a confectioner can separate and classify the various kinds and\r\nqualities of candy in a mixed heap of the article.\r\n\r\nAll at once the town was thrown into a state of extraordinary excitement.\r\nIn mining parlance the Wide West had "struck it rich!"  Everybody went to\r\nsee the new developments, and for some days there was such a crowd of\r\npeople about the Wide West shaft that a stranger would have supposed\r\nthere was a mass meeting in session there.  No other topic was discussed\r\nbut the rich strike, and nobody thought or dreamed about anything else.\r\nEvery man brought away a specimen, ground it up in a hand mortar, washed\r\nit out in his horn spoon, and glared speechless upon the marvelous\r\nresult.  It was not hard rock, but black, decomposed stuff which could be\r\ncrumbled in the hand like a baked potato, and when spread out on a paper\r\nexhibited a thick sprinkling of gold and particles of "native" silver.\r\nHigbie brought a handful to the cabin, and when he had washed it out his\r\namazement was beyond description.  Wide West stock soared skywards.  It\r\nwas said that repeated offers had been made for it at a thousand dollars\r\na foot, and promptly refused.  We have all had the "blues"--the mere\r\nsky-blues--but mine were indigo, now--because I did not own in the Wide\r\nWest.  The world seemed hollow to me, and existence a grief.  I lost my\r\nappetite, and ceased to take an interest in anything.  Still I had to\r\nstay, and listen to other people\'s rejoicings, because I had no money to\r\nget out of the camp with.\r\n\r\nThe Wide West company put a stop to the carrying away of "specimens," and\r\nwell they might, for every handful of the ore was worth a sun of some\r\nconsequence.  To show the exceeding value of the ore, I will remark that\r\na sixteen-hundred-pounds parcel of it was sold, just as it lay, at the\r\nmouth of the shaft, at one dollar a pound; and the man who bought it\r\n"packed" it on mules a hundred and fifty or two hundred miles, over the\r\nmountains, to San Francisco, satisfied that it would yield at a rate that\r\nwould richly compensate him for his trouble.  The Wide West people also\r\ncommanded their foreman to refuse any but their own operatives permission\r\nto enter the mine at any time or for any purpose.  I kept up my "blue"\r\nmeditations and Higbie kept up a deal of thinking, too, but of a\r\ndifferent sort.  He puzzled over the "rock," examined it with a glass,\r\ninspected it in different lights and from different points of view, and\r\nafter each experiment delivered himself, in soliloquy, of one and the\r\nsame unvarying opinion in the same unvarying formula:\r\n\r\n"It is not Wide West rock!"\r\n\r\nHe said once or twice that he meant to have a look into the Wide West\r\nshaft if he got shot for it.  I was wretched, and did not care whether he\r\ngot a look into it or not.  He failed that day, and tried again at night;\r\nfailed again; got up at dawn and tried, and failed again.  Then he lay in\r\nambush in the sage brush hour after hour, waiting for the two or three\r\nhands to adjourn to the shade of a boulder for dinner; made a start once,\r\nbut was premature--one of the men came back for something; tried it\r\nagain, but when almost at the mouth of the shaft, another of the men rose\r\nup from behind the boulder as if to reconnoitre, and he dropped on the\r\nground and lay quiet; presently he crawled on his hands and knees to the\r\nmouth of the shaft, gave a quick glance around, then seized the rope and\r\nslid down the shaft.\r\n\r\nHe disappeared in the gloom of a "side drift" just as a head appeared in\r\nthe mouth of the shaft and somebody shouted "Hello!"--which he did not\r\nanswer.  He was not disturbed any more.  An hour later he entered the\r\ncabin, hot, red, and ready to burst with smothered excitement, and\r\nexclaimed in a stage whisper:\r\n\r\n"I knew it!  We are rich!  IT\'S A BLIND LEAD!"\r\n\r\nI thought the very earth reeled under me.  Doubt--conviction--doubt\r\nagain--exultation--hope, amazement, belief, unbelief--every emotion\r\nimaginable swept in wild procession through my heart and brain, and I\r\ncould not speak a word.  After a moment or two of this mental fury, I\r\nshook myself to rights, and said:\r\n\r\n"Say it again!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s blind lead!"\r\n\r\n"Cal, let\'s--let\'s burn the house--or kill somebody!  Let\'s get out where\r\nthere\'s room to hurrah!  But what is the use?  It is a hundred times too\r\ngood to be true."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a blind lead, for a million!--hanging wall--foot wall--clay\r\ncasings--everything complete!" He swung his hat and gave three cheers,\r\nand I cast doubt to the winds and chimed in with a will.  For I was worth\r\na million dollars, and did not care "whether school kept or not!"\r\n\r\nBut perhaps I ought to explain.  A "blind lead" is a lead or ledge that\r\ndoes not "crop out" above the surface.  A miner does not know where to\r\nlook for such leads, but they are often stumbled upon by accident in the\r\ncourse of driving a tunnel or sinking a shaft.  Higbie knew the Wide West\r\nrock perfectly well, and the more he had examined the new developments\r\nthe more he was satisfied that the ore could not have come from the Wide\r\nWest vein.  And so had it occurred to him alone, of all the camp, that\r\nthere was a blind lead down in the shaft, and that even the Wide West\r\npeople themselves did not suspect it.  He was right.  When he went down\r\nthe shaft, he found that the blind lead held its independent way through\r\nthe Wide West vein, cutting it diagonally, and that it was enclosed in\r\nits own well-defined casing-rocks and clay.  Hence it was public\r\nproperty.  Both leads being perfectly well defined, it was easy for any\r\nminer to see which one belonged to the Wide West and which did not.\r\n\r\nWe thought it well to have a strong friend, and therefore we brought the\r\nforeman of the Wide West to our cabin that night and revealed the great\r\nsurprise to him.  Higbie said:\r\n\r\n"We are going to take possession of this blind lead, record it and\r\nestablish ownership, and then forbid the Wide West company to take out\r\nany more of the rock.  You cannot help your company in this matter\r\n--nobody can help them.  I will go into the shaft with you and prove to\r\nyour entire satisfaction that it is a blind lead.  Now we propose to take\r\nyou in with us, and claim the blind lead in our three names.  What do you\r\nsay?"\r\n\r\nWhat could a man say who had an opportunity to simply stretch forth his\r\nhand and take possession of a fortune without risk of any kind and\r\nwithout wronging any one or attaching the least taint of dishonor to his\r\nname?  He could only say, "Agreed."\r\n\r\nThe notice was put up that night, and duly spread upon the recorder\'s\r\nbooks before ten o\'clock.  We claimed two hundred feet each--six hundred\r\nfeet in all--the smallest and compactest organization in the district,\r\nand the easiest to manage.\r\n\r\nNo one can be so thoughtless as to suppose that we slept, that night.\r\nHigbie and I went to bed at midnight, but it was only to lie broad awake\r\nand think, dream, scheme.  The floorless, tumble-down cabin was a palace,\r\nthe ragged gray blankets silk, the furniture rosewood and mahogany.\r\nEach new splendor that burst out of my visions of the future whirled me\r\nbodily over in bed or jerked me to a sitting posture just as if an\r\nelectric battery had been applied to me.  We shot fragments of\r\nconversation back and forth at each other.  Once Higbie said:\r\n\r\n"When are you going home--to the States?"\r\n\r\n"To-morrow!"--with an evolution or two, ending with a sitting position.\r\n"Well--no--but next month, at furthest."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll go in the same steamer."\r\n\r\n"Agreed."\r\n\r\nA pause.\r\n\r\n"Steamer of the 10th?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  No, the 1st."\r\n\r\n"All right."\r\n\r\nAnother pause.\r\n\r\n"Where are you going to live?"  said Higbie.\r\n\r\n"San Francisco."\r\n\r\n"That\'s me!"\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\n"Too high--too much climbing"--from Higbie.\r\n\r\n"What is?"\r\n\r\n"I was thinking of Russian Hill--building a house up there."\r\n\r\n"Too much climbing?  Shan\'t you keep a carriage?"\r\n\r\n"Of course.  I forgot that."\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\n"Cal., what kind of a house are you going to build?"\r\n\r\n"I was thinking about that.  Three-story and an attic."\r\n\r\n"But what kind?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t hardly know.  Brick, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Brick--bosh."\r\n\r\n"Why?  What is your idea?"\r\n\r\n"Brown stone front--French plate glass--billiard-room off the\r\ndining-room--statuary and paintings--shrubbery and two-acre grass plat\r\n--greenhouse--iron dog on the front stoop--gray horses--landau, and a\r\ncoachman with a bug on his hat!"\r\n\r\n"By George!"\r\n\r\nA long pause.\r\n\r\n"Cal., when are you going to Europe?"\r\n\r\n"Well--I hadn\'t thought of that.  When are you?"\r\n\r\n"In the Spring."\r\n\r\n"Going to be gone all summer?"\r\n\r\n"All summer!  I shall remain there three years."\r\n\r\n"No--but are you in earnest?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I am."\r\n\r\n"I will go along too."\r\n\r\n"Why of course you will."\r\n\r\n"What part of Europe shall you go to?"\r\n\r\n"All parts.  France, England, Germany--Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Syria,\r\nGreece, Palestine, Arabia, Persia, Egypt--all over--everywhere."\r\n\r\n"I\'m agreed."\r\n\r\n"All right."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t it be a swell trip!"\r\n\r\n"We\'ll spend forty or fifty thousand dollars trying to make it one,\r\nanyway."\r\n\r\nAnother long pause.\r\n\r\n"Higbie, we owe the butcher six dollars, and he has been threatening to\r\nstop our--"\r\n\r\n"Hang the butcher!"\r\n\r\n"Amen."\r\n\r\nAnd so it went on.  By three o\'clock we found it was no use, and so we\r\ngot up and played cribbage and smoked pipes till sunrise.  It was my week\r\nto cook.  I always hated cooking--now, I abhorred it.\r\n\r\nThe news was all over town.  The former excitement was great--this one\r\nwas greater still.  I walked the streets serene and happy.  Higbie said\r\nthe foreman had been offered two hundred thousand dollars for his third\r\nof the mine.  I said I would like to see myself selling for any such\r\nprice.  My ideas were lofty.  My figure was a million.  Still, I honestly\r\nbelieve that if I had been offered it, it would have had no other effect\r\nthan to make me hold off for more.\r\n\r\nI found abundant enjoyment in being rich.  A man offered me a\r\nthree-hundred-dollar horse, and wanted to take my simple, unendorsed note\r\nfor it.  That brought the most realizing sense I had yet had that I was\r\nactually rich, beyond shadow of doubt.  It was followed by numerous other\r\nevidences of a similar nature--among which I may mention the fact of the\r\nbutcher leaving us a double supply of meat and saying nothing about\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nBy the laws of the district, the "locators" or claimants of a ledge were\r\nobliged to do a fair and reasonable amount of work on their new property\r\nwithin ten days after the date of the location, or the property was\r\nforfeited, and anybody could go and seize it that chose.  So we\r\ndetermined to go to work the next day.  About the middle of the\r\nafternoon, as I was coming out of the post office, I met a Mr. Gardiner,\r\nwho told me that Capt. John Nye was lying dangerously ill at his place\r\n(the "Nine-Mile Ranch"), and that he and his wife were not able to give\r\nhim nearly as much care and attention as his case demanded.  I said if he\r\nwould wait for me a moment, I would go down and help in the sick room.\r\nI ran to the cabin to tell Higbie.  He was not there, but I left a note\r\non the table for him, and a few minutes later I left town in Gardiner\'s\r\nwagon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nye was very ill indeed, with spasmodic rheumatism.  But the old\r\ngentleman was himself--which is to say, he was kind-hearted and agreeable\r\nwhen comfortable, but a singularly violent wild-cat when things did not\r\ngo well.  He would be smiling along pleasantly enough, when a sudden\r\nspasm of his disease would take him and he would go out of his smile into\r\na perfect fury.  He would groan and wail and howl with the anguish, and\r\nfill up the odd chinks with the most elaborate profanity that strong\r\nconvictions and a fine fancy could contrive.  With fair opportunity he\r\ncould swear very well and handle his adjectives with considerable\r\njudgment; but when the spasm was on him it was painful to listen to him,\r\nhe was so awkward.  However, I had seen him nurse a sick man himself and\r\nput up patiently with the inconveniences of the situation, and\r\nconsequently I was willing that he should have full license now that his\r\nown turn had come.  He could not disturb me, with all his raving and\r\nranting, for my mind had work on hand, and it labored on diligently,\r\nnight and day, whether my hands were idle or employed.  I was altering\r\nand amending the plans for my house, and thinking over the propriety of\r\nhaving the billard-room in the attic, instead of on the same floor with\r\nthe dining-room; also, I was trying to decide between green and blue for\r\nthe upholstery of the drawing-room, for, although my preference was blue\r\nI feared it was a color that would be too easily damaged by dust and\r\nsunlight; likewise while I was content to put the coachman in a modest\r\nlivery, I was uncertain about a footman--I needed one, and was even\r\nresolved to have one, but wished he could properly appear and perform his\r\nfunctions out of livery, for I somewhat dreaded so much show; and yet,\r\ninasmuch as my late grandfather had had a coachman and such things, but\r\nno liveries, I felt rather drawn to beat him;--or beat his ghost, at any\r\nrate; I was also systematizing the European trip, and managed to get it\r\nall laid out, as to route and length of time to be devoted to it\r\n--everything, with one exception--namely, whether to cross the desert from\r\nCairo to Jerusalem per camel, or go by sea to Beirut, and thence down\r\nthrough the country per caravan.  Meantime I was writing to the friends\r\nat home every day, instructing them concerning all my plans and\r\nintentions, and directing them to look up a handsome homestead for my\r\nmother and agree upon a price for it against my coming, and also\r\ndirecting them to sell my share of the Tennessee land and tender the\r\nproceeds to the widows\' and orphans\' fund of the typographical union of\r\nwhich I had long been a member in good standing.  [This Tennessee land\r\nhad been in the possession of the family many years, and promised to\r\nconfer high fortune upon us some day; it still promises it, but in a less\r\nviolent way.]\r\n\r\nWhen I had been nursing the Captain nine days he was somewhat better,\r\nbut very feeble.  During the afternoon we lifted him into a chair and\r\ngave him an alcoholic vapor bath, and then set about putting him on the\r\nbed again.  We had to be exceedingly careful, for the least jar produced\r\npain.  Gardiner had his shoulders and I his legs; in an unfortunate\r\nmoment I stumbled and the patient fell heavily on the bed in an agony of\r\ntorture.  I never heard a man swear so in my life.  He raved like a\r\nmaniac, and tried to snatch a revolver from the table--but I got it.\r\nHe ordered me out of the house, and swore a world of oaths that he would\r\nkill me wherever he caught me when he got on his feet again.  It was\r\nsimply a passing fury, and meant nothing.  I knew he would forget it in\r\nan hour, and maybe be sorry for it, too; but it angered me a little, at\r\nthe moment.  So much so, indeed, that I determined to go back to\r\nEsmeralda.  I thought he was able to get along alone, now, since he was\r\non the war path.  I took supper, and as soon as the moon rose, began my\r\nnine-mile journey, on foot.\r\n\r\nEven millionaires needed no horses, in those days, for a mere nine-mile\r\njaunt without baggage.\r\n\r\nAs I "raised the hill" overlooking the town, it lacked fifteen minutes of\r\ntwelve.  I glanced at the hill over beyond the canyon, and in the bright\r\nmoonlight saw what appeared to be about half the population of the\r\nvillage massed on and around the Wide West croppings.  My heart gave an\r\nexulting bound, and I said to myself, "They have made a new strike\r\nto-night--and struck it richer than ever, no doubt."  I started over\r\nthere, but gave it up.  I said the "strick" would keep, and I had climbed\r\nhill enough for one night.  I went on down through the town, and as I was\r\npassing a little German bakery, a woman ran out and begged me to come in\r\nand help her.  She said her husband had a fit.  I went in, and judged she\r\nwas right--he appeared to have a hundred of them, compressed into one.\r\nTwo Germans were there, trying to hold him, and not making much of a\r\nsuccess of it.  I ran up the street half a block or so and routed out a\r\nsleeping doctor, brought him down half dressed, and we four wrestled with\r\nthe maniac, and doctored, drenched and bled him, for more than an hour,\r\nand the poor German woman did the crying.  He grew quiet, now, and the\r\ndoctor and I withdrew and left him to his friends.\r\n\r\nIt was a little after one o\'clock.  As I entered the cabin door, tired\r\nbut jolly, the dingy light of a tallow candle revealed Higbie, sitting by\r\nthe pine table gazing stupidly at my note, which he held in his fingers,\r\nand looking pale, old, and haggard.  I halted, and looked at him.  He\r\nlooked at me, stolidly.  I said:\r\n\r\n"Higbie, what--what is it?"\r\n\r\n"We\'re ruined--we didn\'t do the work--THE BLIND LEAD\'S RELOCATED!"\r\n\r\nIt was enough.  I sat down sick, grieved--broken-hearted, indeed.  A\r\nminute before, I was rich and brimful of vanity; I was a pauper now, and\r\nvery meek.  We sat still an hour, busy with thought, busy with vain and\r\nuseless self-upbraidings, busy with "Why didn\'t I do this, and why didn\'t\r\nI do that," but neither spoke a word.  Then we dropped into mutual\r\nexplanations, and the mystery was cleared away.  It came out that Higbie\r\nhad depended on me, as I had on him, and as both of us had on the\r\nforeman.  The folly of it!  It was the first time that ever staid and\r\nsteadfast Higbie had left an important matter to chance or failed to be\r\ntrue to his full share of a responsibility.\r\n\r\nBut he had never seen my note till this moment, and this moment was the\r\nfirst time he had been in the cabin since the day he had seen me last.\r\nHe, also, had left a note for me, on that same fatal afternoon--had\r\nridden up on horseback, and looked through the window, and being in a\r\nhurry and not seeing me, had tossed the note into the cabin through a\r\nbroken pane.  Here it was, on the floor, where it had remained\r\nundisturbed for nine days:\r\n\r\n      "Don\'t fail to do the work before the ten days expire.  W.\r\n      has passed through and given me notice.  I am to join him at\r\n      Mono Lake, and we shall go on from there to-night.  He says\r\n      he will find it this time, sure.  CAL."\r\n\r\n"W."  meant Whiteman, of course.  That thrice accursed "cement!"\r\n\r\nThat was the way of it.  An old miner, like Higbie, could no more\r\nwithstand the fascination of a mysterious mining excitement like this\r\n"cement" foolishness, than he could refrain from eating when he was\r\nfamishing.  Higbie had been dreaming about the marvelous cement for\r\nmonths; and now, against his better judgment, he had gone off and "taken\r\nthe chances" on my keeping secure a mine worth a million undiscovered\r\ncement veins.  They had not been followed this time.  His riding out of\r\ntown in broad daylight was such a common-place thing to do that it had\r\nnot attracted any attention.  He said they prosecuted their search in the\r\nfastnesses of the mountains during nine days, without success; they could\r\nnot find the cement.  Then a ghastly fear came over him that something\r\nmight have happened to prevent the doing of the necessary work to hold\r\nthe blind lead (though indeed he thought such a thing hardly possible),\r\nand forthwith he started home with all speed.  He would have reached\r\nEsmeralda in time, but his horse broke down and he had to walk a great\r\npart of the distance.  And so it happened that as he came into Esmeralda\r\nby one road, I entered it by another.  His was the superior energy,\r\nhowever, for he went straight to the Wide West, instead of turning aside\r\nas I had done--and he arrived there about five or ten minutes too late!\r\nThe "notice" was already up, the "relocation" of our mine completed\r\nbeyond recall, and the crowd rapidly dispersing.  He learned some facts\r\nbefore he left the ground.  The foreman had not been seen about the\r\nstreets since the night we had located the mine--a telegram had called\r\nhim to California on a matter of life and death, it was said.  At any\r\nrate he had done no work and the watchful eyes of the community were\r\ntaking note of the fact.  At midnight of this woful tenth day, the ledge\r\nwould be "relocatable," and by eleven o\'clock the hill was black with men\r\nprepared to do the relocating.  That was the crowd I had seen when I\r\nfancied a new "strike" had been made--idiot that I was.\r\n\r\n[We three had the same right to relocate the lead that other people had,\r\nprovided we were quick enough.] As midnight was announced, fourteen men,\r\nduly armed and ready to back their proceedings, put up their "notice" and\r\nproclaimed their ownership of the blind lead, under the new name of the\r\n"Johnson."  But A. D. Allen our partner (the foreman) put in a sudden\r\nappearance about that time, with a cocked revolver in his hand, and said\r\nhis name must be added to the list, or he would "thin out the Johnson\r\ncompany some."  He was a manly, splendid, determined fellow, and known to\r\nbe as good as his word, and therefore a compromise was effected.  They\r\nput in his name for a hundred feet, reserving to themselves the customary\r\ntwo hundred feet each.  Such was the history of the night\'s events, as\r\nHigbie gathered from a friend on the way home.\r\n\r\nHigbie and I cleared out on a new mining excitement the next morning,\r\nglad to get away from the scene of our sufferings, and after a month or\r\ntwo of hardship and disappointment, returned to Esmeralda once more.\r\nThen we learned that the Wide West and the Johnson companies had\r\nconsolidated; that the stock, thus united, comprised five thousand feet,\r\nor shares; that the foreman, apprehending tiresome litigation, and\r\nconsidering such a huge concern unwieldy, had sold his hundred feet for\r\nninety thousand dollars in gold and gone home to the States to enjoy it.\r\nIf the stock was worth such a gallant figure, with five thousand shares\r\nin the corporation, it makes me dizzy to think what it would have been\r\nworth with only our original six hundred in it.  It was the difference\r\nbetween six hundred men owning a house and five thousand owning it.  We\r\nwould have been millionaires if we had only worked with pick and spade\r\none little day on our property and so secured our ownership!\r\n\r\nIt reads like a wild fancy sketch, but the evidence of many witnesses,\r\nand likewise that of the official records of Esmeralda District, is\r\neasily obtainable in proof that it is a true history.  I can always have\r\nit to say that I was absolutely and unquestionably worth a million\r\ndollars, once, for ten days.\r\n\r\nA year ago my esteemed and in every way estimable old millionaire\r\npartner, Higbie, wrote me from an obscure little mining camp in\r\nCalifornia that after nine or ten years of buffetings and hard striving,\r\nhe was at last in a position where he could command twenty-five hundred\r\ndollars, and said he meant to go into the fruit business in a modest way.\r\nHow such a thought would have insulted him the night we lay in our cabin\r\nplanning European trips and brown stone houses on Russian Hill!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nWhat to do next?\r\n\r\nIt was a momentous question.  I had gone out into the world to shift for\r\nmyself, at the age of thirteen (for my father had endorsed for friends;\r\nand although he left us a sumptuous legacy of pride in his fine Virginian\r\nstock and its national distinction, I presently found that I could not\r\nlive on that alone without occasional bread to wash it down with).  I had\r\ngained a livelihood in various vocations, but had not dazzled anybody\r\nwith my successes; still the list was before me, and the amplest liberty\r\nin the matter of choosing, provided I wanted to work--which I did not,\r\nafter being so wealthy.  I had once been a grocery clerk, for one day,\r\nbut had consumed so much sugar in that time that I was relieved from\r\nfurther duty by the proprietor; said he wanted me outside, so that he\r\ncould have my custom.  I had studied law an entire week, and then given\r\nit up because it was so prosy and tiresome.  I had engaged briefly in the\r\nstudy of blacksmithing, but wasted so much time trying to fix the bellows\r\nso that it would blow itself, that the master turned me adrift in\r\ndisgrace, and told me I would come to no good.  I had been a bookseller\'s\r\nclerk for awhile, but the customers bothered me so much I could not read\r\nwith any comfort, and so the proprietor gave me a furlough and forgot to\r\nput a limit to it.  I had clerked in a drug store part of a summer, but\r\nmy prescriptions were unlucky, and we appeared to sell more stomach pumps\r\nthan soda water.  So I had to go.  I had made of myself a tolerable\r\nprinter, under the impression that I would be another Franklin some day,\r\nbut somehow had missed the connection thus far.  There was no berth open\r\nin the Esmeralda Union, and besides I had always been such a slow\r\ncompositor that I looked with envy upon the achievements of apprentices\r\nof two years\' standing; and when I took a "take," foremen were in the\r\nhabit of suggesting that it would be wanted "some time during the year."\r\n\r\nI was a good average St. Louis and New Orleans pilot and by no means\r\nashamed of my abilities in that line; wages were two hundred and fifty\r\ndollars a month and no board to pay, and I did long to stand behind a\r\nwheel again and never roam any more--but I had been making such an ass of\r\nmyself lately in grandiloquent letters home about my blind lead and my\r\nEuropean excursion that I did what many and many a poor disappointed\r\nminer had done before; said "It is all over with me now, and I will never\r\ngo back home to be pitied--and snubbed."  I had been a private secretary,\r\na silver miner and a silver mill operative, and amounted to less than\r\nnothing in each, and now--\r\n\r\nWhat to do next?\r\n\r\nI yielded to Higbie\'s appeals and consented to try the mining once more.\r\nWe climbed far up on the mountain side and went to work on a little\r\nrubbishy claim of ours that had a shaft on it eight feet deep.  Higbie\r\ndescended into it and worked bravely with his pick till he had loosened\r\nup a deal of rock and dirt and then I went down with a long-handled\r\nshovel (the most awkward invention yet contrived by man) to throw it out.\r\nYou must brace the shovel forward with the side of your knee till it is\r\nfull, and then, with a skilful toss, throw it backward over your left\r\nshoulder.  I made the toss, and landed the mess just on the edge of the\r\nshaft and it all came back on my head and down the back of my neck.\r\nI never said a word, but climbed out and walked home.  I inwardly\r\nresolved that I would starve before I would make a target of myself and\r\nshoot rubbish at it with a long-handled shovel.\r\n\r\nI sat down, in the cabin, and gave myself up to solid misery--so to\r\nspeak.  Now in pleasanter days I had amused myself with writing letters\r\nto the chief paper of the Territory, the Virginia Daily Territorial\r\nEnterprise, and had always been surprised when they appeared in print.\r\nMy good opinion of the editors had steadily declined; for it seemed to me\r\nthat they might have found something better to fill up with than my\r\nliterature.  I had found a letter in the post office as I came home from\r\nthe hill side, and finally I opened it.  Eureka!  [I never did know what\r\nEureka meant, but it seems to be as proper a word to heave in as any when\r\nno other that sounds pretty offers.] It was a deliberate offer to me of\r\nTwenty-Five Dollars a week to come up to Virginia and be city editor of\r\nthe Enterprise.\r\n\r\nI would have challenged the publisher in the "blind lead" days--I wanted\r\nto fall down and worship him, now.  Twenty-Five Dollars a week--it looked\r\nlike bloated luxury--a fortune a sinful and lavish waste of money.\r\nBut my transports cooled when I thought of my inexperience and consequent\r\nunfitness for the position--and straightway, on top of this, my long\r\narray of failures rose up before me.  Yet if I refused this place I must\r\npresently become dependent upon somebody for my bread, a thing\r\nnecessarily distasteful to a man who had never experienced such a\r\nhumiliation since he was thirteen years old.  Not much to be proud of,\r\nsince it is so common--but then it was all I had to be proud of.  So I\r\nwas scared into being a city editor.  I would have declined, otherwise.\r\nNecessity is the mother of "taking chances."  I do not doubt that if, at\r\nthat time, I had been offered a salary to translate the Talmud from the\r\noriginal Hebrew, I would have accepted--albeit with diffidence and some\r\nmisgivings--and thrown as much variety into it as I could for the money.\r\n\r\nI went up to Virginia and entered upon my new vocation.  I was a rusty\r\nlooking city editor, I am free to confess--coatless, slouch hat, blue\r\nwoolen shirt, pantaloons stuffed into boot-tops, whiskered half down to\r\nthe waist, and the universal navy revolver slung to my belt.  But I\r\nsecured a more Christian costume and discarded the revolver.\r\n\r\nI had never had occasion to kill anybody, nor ever felt a desire to do\r\nso, but had worn the thing in deference to popular sentiment, and in\r\norder that I might not, by its absence, be offensively conspicuous, and a\r\nsubject of remark.  But the other editors, and all the printers, carried\r\nrevolvers.  I asked the chief editor and proprietor (Mr. Goodman, I will\r\ncall him, since it describes him as well as any name could do) for some\r\ninstructions with regard to my duties, and he told me to go all over town\r\nand ask all sorts of people all sorts of questions, make notes of the\r\ninformation gained, and write them out for publication.  And he added:\r\n\r\n"Never say \'We learn\' so-and-so, or \'It is reported,\' or \'It is rumored,\'\r\nor \'We understand\' so-and-so, but go to headquarters and get the absolute\r\nfacts, and then speak out and say \'It is so-and-so.\'  Otherwise, people\r\nwill not put confidence in your news.  Unassailable certainly is the\r\nthing that gives a newspaper the firmest and most valuable reputation."\r\n\r\nIt was the whole thing in a nut-shell; and to this day when I find a\r\nreporter commencing his article with "We understand," I gather a\r\nsuspicion that he has not taken as much pains to inform himself as he\r\nought to have done.  I moralize well, but I did not always practise well\r\nwhen I was a city editor; I let fancy get the upper hand of fact too\r\noften when there was a dearth of news.  I can never forget my first day\'s\r\nexperience as a reporter.  I wandered about town questioning everybody,\r\nboring everybody, and finding out that nobody knew anything.  At the end\r\nof five hours my notebook was still barren.  I spoke to Mr. Goodman.  He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"Dan used to make a good thing out of the hay wagons in a dry time when\r\nthere were no fires or inquests.  Are there no hay wagons in from the\r\nTruckee?  If there are, you might speak of the renewed activity and all\r\nthat sort of thing, in the hay business, you know.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t sensational or exciting, but it fills up and looks business\r\nlike."\r\n\r\nI canvassed the city again and found one wretched old hay truck dragging\r\nin from the country.  But I made affluent use of it.  I multiplied it by\r\nsixteen, brought it into town from sixteen different directions, made\r\nsixteen separate items out of it, and got up such another sweat about hay\r\nas Virginia City had never seen in the world before.\r\n\r\nThis was encouraging.  Two nonpareil columns had to be filled, and I was\r\ngetting along.  Presently, when things began to look dismal again, a\r\ndesperado killed a man in a saloon and joy returned once more.  I never\r\nwas so glad over any mere trifle before in my life.  I said to the\r\nmurderer:\r\n\r\n"Sir, you are a stranger to me, but you have done me a kindness this day\r\nwhich I can never forget.  If whole years of gratitude can be to you any\r\nslight compensation, they shall be yours.  I was in trouble and you have\r\nrelieved me nobly and at a time when all seemed dark and drear.  Count me\r\nyour friend from this time forth, for I am not a man to forget a favor."\r\n\r\nIf I did not really say that to him I at least felt a sort of itching\r\ndesire to do it.  I wrote up the murder with a hungry attention to\r\ndetails, and when it was finished experienced but one regret--namely,\r\nthat they had not hanged my benefactor on the spot, so that I could work\r\nhim up too.\r\n\r\nNext I discovered some emigrant wagons going into camp on the plaza and\r\nfound that they had lately come through the hostile Indian country and\r\nhad fared rather roughly.  I made the best of the item that the\r\ncircumstances permitted, and felt that if I were not confined within\r\nrigid limits by the presence of the reporters of the other papers I could\r\nadd particulars that would make the article much more interesting.\r\nHowever, I found one wagon that was going on to California, and made some\r\njudicious inquiries of the proprietor.  When I learned, through his short\r\nand surly answers to my cross-questioning, that he was certainly going on\r\nand would not be in the city next day to make trouble, I got ahead of the\r\nother papers, for I took down his list of names and added his party to\r\nthe killed and wounded.  Having more scope here, I put this wagon through\r\nan Indian fight that to this day has no parallel in history.\r\n\r\nMy two columns were filled.  When I read them over in the morning I felt\r\nthat I had found my legitimate occupation at last.  I reasoned within\r\nmyself that news, and stirring news, too, was what a paper needed, and I\r\nfelt that I was peculiarly endowed with the ability to furnish it.\r\nMr. Goodman said that I was as good a reporter as Dan.  I desired no\r\nhigher commendation.  With encouragement like that, I felt that I could\r\ntake my pen and murder all the immigrants on the plains if need be and\r\nthe interests of the paper demanded it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nHowever, as I grew better acquainted with the business and learned the\r\nrun of the sources of information I ceased to require the aid of fancy to\r\nany large extent, and became able to fill my columns without diverging\r\nnoticeably from the domain of fact.\r\n\r\nI struck up friendships with the reporters of the other journals, and we\r\nswapped "regulars" with each other and thus economized work.  "Regulars"\r\nare permanent sources of news, like courts, bullion returns, "clean-ups"\r\nat the quartz mills, and inquests.  Inasmuch as everybody went armed, we\r\nhad an inquest about every day, and so this department was naturally set\r\ndown among the "regulars."  We had lively papers in those days.  My great\r\ncompetitor among the reporters was Boggs of the Union.  He was an\r\nexcellent reporter.  Once in three or four months he would get a little\r\nintoxicated, but as a general thing he was a wary and cautious drinker\r\nalthough always ready to tamper a little with the enemy.  He had the\r\nadvantage of me in one thing; he could get the monthly public school\r\nreport and I could not, because the principal hated the Enterprise.\r\nOne snowy night when the report was due, I started out sadly wondering\r\nhow I was going to get it.  Presently, a few steps up the almost deserted\r\nstreet I stumbled on Boggs and asked him where he was going.\r\n\r\n"After the school report."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go along with you."\r\n\r\n"No, sir.  I\'ll excuse you."\r\n\r\n"Just as you say."\r\n\r\nA saloon-keeper\'s boy passed by with a steaming pitcher of hot punch, and\r\nBoggs snuffed the fragrance gratefully.  He gazed fondly after the boy\r\nand saw him start up the Enterprise stairs.  I said:\r\n\r\n"I wish you could help me get that school business, but since you can\'t,\r\nI must run up to the Union office and see if I can get them to let me\r\nhave a proof of it after they have set it up, though I don\'t begin to\r\nsuppose they will.  Good night."\r\n\r\n"Hold on a minute.  I don\'t mind getting the report and sitting around\r\nwith the boys a little, while you copy it, if you\'re willing to drop down\r\nto the principal\'s with me."\r\n\r\n"Now you talk like a rational being.  Come along."\r\n\r\nWe plowed a couple of blocks through the snow, got the report and\r\nreturned to our office.  It was a short document and soon copied.\r\nMeantime Boggs helped himself to the punch.  I gave the manuscript back\r\nto him and we started out to get an inquest, for we heard pistol shots\r\nnear by.  We got the particulars with little loss of time, for it was\r\nonly an inferior sort of bar-room murder, and of little interest to the\r\npublic, and then we separated.  Away at three o\'clock in the morning,\r\nwhen we had gone to press and were having a relaxing concert as usual\r\n--for some of the printers were good singers and others good performers on\r\nthe guitar and on that atrocity the accordion--the proprietor of the\r\nUnion strode in and desired to know if anybody had heard anything of\r\nBoggs or the school report.  We stated the case, and all turned out to\r\nhelp hunt for the delinquent.  We found him standing on a table in a\r\nsaloon, with an old tin lantern in one hand and the school report in the\r\nother, haranguing a gang of intoxicated Cornish miners on the iniquity of\r\nsquandering the public moneys on education "when hundreds and hundreds of\r\nhonest hard-working men are literally starving for whiskey."  [Riotous\r\napplause.]  He had been assisting in a regal spree with those parties for\r\nhours.  We dragged him away and put him to bed.\r\n\r\nOf course there was no school report in the Union, and Boggs held me\r\naccountable, though I was innocent of any intention or desire to compass\r\nits absence from that paper and was as sorry as any one that the\r\nmisfortune had occurred.\r\n\r\nBut we were perfectly friendly.  The day that the school report was next\r\ndue, the proprietor of the "Genessee" mine furnished us a buggy and asked\r\nus to go down and write something about the property--a very common\r\nrequest and one always gladly acceded to when people furnished buggies,\r\nfor we were as fond of pleasure excursions as other people.  In due time\r\nwe arrived at the "mine"--nothing but a hole in the ground ninety feet\r\ndeep, and no way of getting down into it but by holding on to a rope and\r\nbeing lowered with a windlass.  The workmen had just gone off somewhere\r\nto dinner.  I was not strong enough to lower Boggs\'s bulk; so I took an\r\nunlighted candle in my teeth, made a loop for my foot in the end of the\r\nrope, implored Boggs not to go to sleep or let the windlass get the start\r\nof him, and then swung out over the shaft.  I reached the bottom muddy\r\nand bruised about the elbows, but safe.  I lit the candle, made an\r\nexamination of the rock, selected some specimens and shouted to Boggs to\r\nhoist away.  No answer.  Presently a head appeared in the circle of\r\ndaylight away aloft, and a voice came down:\r\n\r\n"Are you all set?"\r\n\r\n"All set--hoist away."\r\n\r\n"Are you comfortable?"\r\n\r\n"Perfectly."\r\n\r\n"Could you wait a little?"\r\n\r\n"Oh certainly--no particular hurry."\r\n\r\n"Well--good by."\r\n\r\n"Why?  Where are you going?"\r\n\r\n"After the school report!"\r\n\r\nAnd he did.  I staid down there an hour, and surprised the workmen when\r\nthey hauled up and found a man on the rope instead of a bucket of rock.\r\nI walked home, too--five miles--up hill.  We had no school report next\r\nmorning; but the Union had.\r\n\r\nSix months after my entry into journalism the grand "flush times" of\r\nSilverland began, and they continued with unabated splendor for three\r\nyears.  All difficulty about filling up the "local department" ceased,\r\nand the only trouble now was how to make the lengthened columns hold the\r\nworld of incidents and happenings that came to our literary net every\r\nday.  Virginia had grown to be the "livest" town, for its age and\r\npopulation, that America had ever produced.  The sidewalks swarmed with\r\npeople--to such an extent, indeed, that it was generally no easy matter\r\nto stem the human tide.  The streets themselves were just as crowded with\r\nquartz wagons, freight teams and other vehicles.  The procession was\r\nendless.  So great was the pack, that buggies frequently had to wait half\r\nan hour for an opportunity to cross the principal street.  Joy sat on\r\nevery countenance, and there was a glad, almost fierce, intensity in\r\nevery eye, that told of the money-getting schemes that were seething in\r\nevery brain and the high hope that held sway in every heart.  Money was\r\nas plenty as dust; every individual considered himself wealthy, and a\r\nmelancholy countenance was nowhere to be seen.  There were military\r\ncompanies, fire companies, brass bands, banks, hotels, theatres,\r\n"hurdy-gurdy houses," wide-open gambling palaces, political pow-wows,\r\ncivic processions, street fights, murders, inquests, riots, a whiskey\r\nmill every fifteen steps, a Board of Aldermen, a Mayor, a City Surveyor,\r\na City Engineer, a Chief of the Fire Department, with First, Second and\r\nThird Assistants, a Chief of Police, City Marshal and a large police\r\nforce, two Boards of Mining Brokers, a dozen breweries and half a dozen\r\njails and station-houses in full operation, and some talk of building a\r\nchurch.  The "flush times" were in magnificent flower!  Large fire-proof\r\nbrick buildings were going up in the principal streets, and the wooden\r\nsuburbs were spreading out in all directions.  Town lots soared up to\r\nprices that were amazing.\r\n\r\nThe great "Comstock lode" stretched its opulent length straight through\r\nthe town from north to south, and every mine on it was in diligent\r\nprocess of development.  One of these mines alone employed six hundred\r\nand seventy-five men, and in the matter of elections the adage was, "as\r\nthe \'Gould and Curry\' goes, so goes the city."  Laboring men\'s wages were\r\nfour and six dollars a day, and they worked in three "shifts" or gangs,\r\nand the blasting and picking and shoveling went on without ceasing, night\r\nand day.\r\n\r\nThe "city" of Virginia roosted royally midway up the steep side of Mount\r\nDavidson, seven thousand two hundred feet above the level of the sea, and\r\nin the clear Nevada atmosphere was visible from a distance of fifty\r\nmiles!  It claimed a population of fifteen thousand to eighteen thousand,\r\nand all day long half of this little army swarmed the streets like bees\r\nand the other half swarmed among the drifts and tunnels of the\r\n"Comstock," hundreds of feet down in the earth directly under those same\r\nstreets.  Often we felt our chairs jar, and heard the faint boom of a\r\nblast down in the bowels of the earth under the office.\r\n\r\nThe mountain side was so steep that the entire town had a slant to it\r\nlike a roof.  Each street was a terrace, and from each to the next street\r\nbelow the descent was forty or fifty feet.  The fronts of the houses were\r\nlevel with the street they faced, but their rear first floors were\r\npropped on lofty stilts; a man could stand at a rear first floor window\r\nof a C street house and look down the chimneys of the row of houses below\r\nhim facing D street.  It was a laborious climb, in that thin atmosphere,\r\nto ascend from D to A street, and you were panting and out of breath when\r\nyou got there; but you could turn around and go down again like a house\r\na-fire--so to speak.  The atmosphere was so rarified, on account of the\r\ngreat altitude, that one\'s blood lay near the surface always, and the\r\nscratch of a pin was a disaster worth worrying about, for the chances\r\nwere that a grievous erysipelas would ensue.  But to offset this, the\r\nthin atmosphere seemed to carry healing to gunshot wounds, and therefore,\r\nto simply shoot your adversary through both lungs was a thing not likely\r\nto afford you any permanent satisfaction, for he would be nearly certain\r\nto be around looking for you within the month, and not with an opera\r\nglass, either.\r\n\r\nFrom Virginia\'s airy situation one could look over a vast, far-reaching\r\npanorama of mountain ranges and deserts; and whether the day was bright\r\nor overcast, whether the sun was rising or setting, or flaming in the\r\nzenith, or whether night and the moon held sway, the spectacle was always\r\nimpressive and beautiful.  Over your head Mount Davidson lifted its gray\r\ndome, and before and below you a rugged canyon clove the battlemented\r\nhills, making a sombre gateway through which a soft-tinted desert was\r\nglimpsed, with the silver thread of a river winding through it, bordered\r\nwith trees which many miles of distance diminished to a delicate fringe;\r\nand still further away the snowy mountains rose up and stretched their\r\nlong barrier to the filmy horizon--far enough beyond a lake that burned\r\nin the desert like a fallen sun, though that, itself, lay fifty miles\r\nremoved.  Look from your window where you would, there was fascination in\r\nthe picture.  At rare intervals--but very rare--there were clouds in our\r\nskies, and then the setting sun would gild and flush and glorify this\r\nmighty expanse of scenery with a bewildering pomp of color that held the\r\neye like a spell and moved the spirit like music.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nMy salary was increased to forty dollars a week.  But I seldom drew it.\r\nI had plenty of other resources, and what were two broad twenty-dollar\r\ngold pieces to a man who had his pockets full of such and a cumbersome\r\nabundance of bright half dollars besides?  [Paper money has never come\r\ninto use on the Pacific coast.]  Reporting was lucrative, and every man\r\nin the town was lavish with his money and his "feet."  The city and all\r\nthe great mountain side were riddled with mining shafts.  There were more\r\nmines than miners.  True, not ten of these mines were yielding rock worth\r\nhauling to a mill, but everybody said, "Wait till the shaft gets down\r\nwhere the ledge comes in solid, and then you will see!"  So nobody was\r\ndiscouraged.  These were nearly all "wild cat" mines, and wholly\r\nworthless, but nobody believed it then.  The "Ophir," the "Gould &\r\nCurry," the "Mexican," and other great mines on the Comstock lead in\r\nVirginia and Gold Hill were turning out huge piles of rich rock every\r\nday, and every man believed that his little wild cat claim was as good as\r\nany on the "main lead" and would infallibly be worth a thousand dollars a\r\nfoot when he "got down where it came in solid."  Poor fellow, he was\r\nblessedly blind to the fact that he never would see that day.  So the\r\nthousand wild cat shafts burrowed deeper and deeper into the earth day by\r\nday, and all men were beside themselves with hope and happiness.  How\r\nthey labored, prophesied, exulted!  Surely nothing like it was ever seen\r\nbefore since the world began.  Every one of these wild cat mines--not\r\nmines, but holes in the ground over imaginary mines--was incorporated and\r\nhad handsomely engraved "stock" and the stock was salable, too.  It was\r\nbought and sold with a feverish avidity in the boards every day.  You\r\ncould go up on the mountain side, scratch around and find a ledge (there\r\nwas no lack of them), put up a "notice" with a grandiloquent name in it,\r\nstart a shaft, get your stock printed, and with nothing whatever to prove\r\nthat your mine was worth a straw, you could put your stock on the market\r\nand sell out for hundreds and even thousands of dollars.  To make money,\r\nand make it fast, was as easy as it was to eat your dinner.\r\n\r\nEvery man owned "feet" in fifty different wild cat mines and considered\r\nhis fortune made.  Think of a city with not one solitary poor man in it!\r\nOne would suppose that when month after month went by and still not a\r\nwild cat mine (by wild cat I mean, in general terms, any claim not\r\nlocated on the mother vein, i.e., the "Comstock") yielded a ton of rock\r\nworth crushing, the people would begin to wonder if they were not putting\r\ntoo much faith in their prospective riches; but there was not a thought\r\nof such a thing.  They burrowed away, bought and sold, and were happy.\r\n\r\nNew claims were taken up daily, and it was the friendly custom to run\r\nstraight to the newspaper offices, give the reporter forty or fifty\r\n"feet," and get them to go and examine the mine and publish a notice of\r\nit.  They did not care a fig what you said about the property so you said\r\nsomething.  Consequently we generally said a word or two to the effect\r\nthat the "indications" were good, or that the ledge was "six feet wide,"\r\nor that the rock "resembled the Comstock" (and so it did--but as a\r\ngeneral thing the resemblance was not startling enough to knock you\r\ndown).  If the rock was moderately promising, we followed the custom of\r\nthe country, used strong adjectives and frothed at the mouth as if a very\r\nmarvel in silver discoveries had transpired.  If the mine was a\r\n"developed" one, and had no pay ore to show (and of course it hadn\'t), we\r\npraised the tunnel; said it was one of the most infatuating tunnels in\r\nthe land; driveled and driveled about the tunnel till we ran entirely out\r\nof ecstasies--but never said a word about the rock.  We would squander\r\nhalf a column of adulation on a shaft, or a new wire rope, or a dressed\r\npine windlass, or a fascinating force pump, and close with a burst of\r\nadmiration of the "gentlemanly and efficient Superintendent" of the mine\r\n--but never utter a whisper about the rock.  And those people were always\r\npleased, always satisfied.  Occasionally we patched up and varnished our\r\nreputation for discrimination and stern, undeviating accuracy, by giving\r\nsome old abandoned claim a blast that ought to have made its dry bones\r\nrattle--and then somebody would seize it and sell it on the fleeting\r\nnotoriety thus conferred upon it.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in the shape of a mining claim that was not salable.\r\nWe received presents of "feet" every day.  If we needed a hundred dollars\r\nor so, we sold some; if not, we hoarded it away, satisfied that it would\r\nultimately be worth a thousand dollars a foot.  I had a trunk about half\r\nfull of "stock."  When a claim made a stir in the market and went up to a\r\nhigh figure, I searched through my pile to see if I had any of its stock\r\n--and generally found it.\r\n\r\nThe prices rose and fell constantly; but still a fall disturbed us\r\nlittle, because a thousand dollars a foot was our figure, and so we were\r\ncontent to let it fluctuate as much as it pleased till it reached it.\r\nMy pile of stock was not all given to me by people who wished their\r\nclaims "noticed."  At least half of it was given me by persons who had no\r\nthought of such a thing, and looked for nothing more than a simple verbal\r\n"thank you;" and you were not even obliged by law to furnish that.\r\nIf you are coming up the street with a couple of baskets of apples in\r\nyour hands, and you meet a friend, you naturally invite him to take a\r\nfew.  That describes the condition of things in Virginia in the "flush\r\ntimes."  Every man had his pockets full of stock, and it was the actual\r\ncustom of the country to part with small quantities of it to friends\r\nwithout the asking.\r\n\r\nVery often it was a good idea to close the transaction instantly, when a\r\nman offered a stock present to a friend, for the offer was only good and\r\nbinding at that moment, and if the price went to a high figure shortly\r\nafterward the procrastination was a thing to be regretted.  Mr. Stewart\r\n(Senator, now, from Nevada) one day told me he would give me twenty feet\r\nof "Justis" stock if I would walk over to his office.  It was worth five\r\nor ten dollars a foot.  I asked him to make the offer good for next day,\r\nas I was just going to dinner.  He said he would not be in town; so I\r\nrisked it and took my dinner instead of the stock.  Within the week the\r\nprice went up to seventy dollars and afterward to a hundred and fifty,\r\nbut nothing could make that man yield.  I suppose he sold that stock of\r\nmine and placed the guilty proceeds in his own pocket.  [My revenge will\r\nbe found in the accompanying portrait.]  I met three friends one\r\nafternoon, who said they had been buying "Overman" stock at auction at\r\neight dollars a foot.  One said if I would come up to his office he would\r\ngive me fifteen feet; another said he would add fifteen; the third said\r\nhe would do the same.  But I was going after an inquest and could not\r\nstop.  A few weeks afterward they sold all their "Overman" at six hundred\r\ndollars a foot and generously came around to tell me about it--and also\r\nto urge me to accept of the next forty-five feet of it that people tried\r\nto force on me.\r\n\r\nThese are actual facts, and I could make the list a long one and still\r\nconfine myself strictly to the truth.  Many a time friends gave us as\r\nmuch as twenty-five feet of stock that was selling at twenty-five dollars\r\na foot, and they thought no more of it than they would of offering a\r\nguest a cigar.  These were "flush times" indeed!  I thought they were\r\ngoing to last always, but somehow I never was much of a prophet.\r\n\r\nTo show what a wild spirit possessed the mining brain of the community,\r\nI will remark that "claims" were actually "located" in excavations for\r\ncellars, where the pick had exposed what seemed to be quartz veins--and\r\nnot cellars in the suburbs, either, but in the very heart of the city;\r\nand forthwith stock would be issued and thrown on the market.  It was\r\nsmall matter who the cellar belonged to--the "ledge" belonged to the\r\nfinder, and unless the United States government interfered (inasmuch as\r\nthe government holds the primary right to mines of the noble metals in\r\nNevada--or at least did then), it was considered to be his privilege to\r\nwork it.  Imagine a stranger staking out a mining claim among the costly\r\nshrubbery in your front yard and calmly proceeding to lay waste the\r\nground with pick and shovel and blasting powder!  It has been often done\r\nin California.  In the middle of one of the principal business streets of\r\nVirginia, a man "located" a mining claim and began a shaft on it.  He\r\ngave me a hundred feet of the stock and I sold it for a fine suit of\r\nclothes because I was afraid somebody would fall down the shaft and sue\r\nfor damages.  I owned in another claim that was located in the middle of\r\nanother street; and to show how absurd people can be, that "East India"\r\nstock (as it was called) sold briskly although there was an ancient\r\ntunnel running directly under the claim and any man could go into it and\r\nsee that it did not cut a quartz ledge or anything that remotely\r\nresembled one.\r\n\r\nOne plan of acquiring sudden wealth was to "salt" a wild cat claim and\r\nsell out while the excitement was up.  The process was simple.\r\n\r\nThe schemer located a worthless ledge, sunk a shaft on it, bought a wagon\r\nload of rich "Comstock" ore, dumped a portion of it into the shaft and\r\npiled the rest by its side, above ground.  Then he showed the property to\r\na simpleton and sold it to him at a high figure.  Of course the wagon\r\nload of rich ore was all that the victim ever got out of his purchase.\r\nA most remarkable case of "salting" was that of the "North Ophir."\r\nIt was claimed that this vein was a "remote extension" of the original\r\n"Ophir," a valuable mine on the "Comstock."  For a few days everybody was\r\ntalking about the rich developments in the North Ophir.  It was said that\r\nit yielded perfectly pure silver in small, solid lumps.  I went to the\r\nplace with the owners, and found a shaft six or eight feet deep, in the\r\nbottom of which was a badly shattered vein of dull, yellowish,\r\nunpromising rock.  One would as soon expect to find silver in a\r\ngrindstone.  We got out a pan of the rubbish and washed it in a puddle,\r\nand sure enough, among the sediment we found half a dozen black,\r\nbullet-looking pellets of unimpeachable "native" silver.  Nobody had ever\r\nheard of such a thing before; science could not account for such a queer\r\nnovelty.  The stock rose to sixty-five dollars a foot, and at this figure\r\nthe world-renowned tragedian, McKean Buchanan, bought a commanding\r\ninterest and prepared to quit the stage once more--he was always doing\r\nthat.  And then it transpired that the mine had been "salted"--and not in\r\nany hackneyed way, either, but in a singularly bold, barefaced and\r\npeculiarly original and outrageous fashion.  On one of the lumps of\r\n"native" silver was discovered the minted legend, "TED STATES OF," and\r\nthen it was plainly apparent that the mine had been "salted" with melted\r\nhalf-dollars!  The lumps thus obtained had been blackened till they\r\nresembled native silver, and were then mixed with the shattered rock in\r\nthe bottom of the shaft.  It is literally true.  Of course the price of\r\nthe stock at once fell to nothing, and the tragedian was ruined.  But for\r\nthis calamity we might have lost McKean Buchanan from the stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nThe "flush times" held bravely on.  Something over two years before, Mr.\r\nGoodman and another journeyman printer, had borrowed forty dollars and\r\nset out from San Francisco to try their fortunes in the new city of\r\nVirginia.  They found the Territorial Enterprise, a poverty-stricken\r\nweekly journal, gasping for breath and likely to die.  They bought it,\r\ntype, fixtures, good-will and all, for a thousand dollars, on long time.\r\nThe editorial sanctum, news-room, press-room, publication office,\r\nbed-chamber, parlor, and kitchen were all compressed into one apartment\r\nand it was a small one, too.  The editors and printers slept on the\r\nfloor, a Chinaman did their cooking, and the "imposing-stone" was the\r\ngeneral dinner table.  But now things were changed.  The paper was a\r\ngreat daily, printed by steam; there were five editors and twenty-three\r\ncompositors; the subscription price was sixteen dollars a year; the\r\nadvertising rates were exorbitant, and the columns crowded.  The paper\r\nwas clearing from six to ten thousand dollars a month, and the\r\n"Enterprise Building" was finished and ready for occupation--a stately\r\nfireproof brick.  Every day from five all the way up to eleven columns\r\nof "live" advertisements were left out or crowded into spasmodic and\r\nirregular "supplements."\r\n\r\nThe "Gould & Curry" company were erecting a monster hundred-stamp mill at\r\na cost that ultimately fell little short of a million dollars.  Gould &\r\nCurry stock paid heavy dividends--a rare thing, and an experience\r\nconfined to the dozen or fifteen claims located on the "main lead," the\r\n"Comstock."  The Superintendent of the Gould & Curry lived, rent free, in\r\na fine house built and furnished by the company.  He drove a fine pair of\r\nhorses which were a present from the company, and his salary was twelve\r\nthousand dollars a year.  The superintendent of another of the great\r\nmines traveled in grand state, had a salary of twenty-eight thousand\r\ndollars a year, and in a law suit in after days claimed that he was to\r\nhave had one per cent. on the gross yield of the bullion likewise.\r\n\r\nMoney was wonderfully plenty.  The trouble was, not how to get it,--but\r\nhow to spend it, how to lavish it, get rid of it, squander it.  And so it\r\nwas a happy thing that just at this juncture the news came over the wires\r\nthat a great United States Sanitary Commission had been formed and money\r\nwas wanted for the relief of the wounded sailors and soldiers of the\r\nUnion languishing in the Eastern hospitals.  Right on the heels of it\r\ncame word that San Francisco had responded superbly before the telegram\r\nwas half a day old.  Virginia rose as one man!  A Sanitary Committee was\r\nhurriedly organized, and its chairman mounted a vacant cart in C street\r\nand tried to make the clamorous multitude understand that the rest of the\r\ncommittee were flying hither and thither and working with all their might\r\nand main, and that if the town would only wait an hour, an office would\r\nbe ready, books opened, and the Commission prepared to receive\r\ncontributions.  His voice was drowned and his information lost in a\r\nceaseless roar of cheers, and demands that the money be received now\r\n--they swore they would not wait.  The chairman pleaded and argued, but,\r\ndeaf to all entreaty, men plowed their way through the throng and rained\r\nchecks of gold coin into the cart and skurried away for more.  Hands\r\nclutching money, were thrust aloft out of the jam by men who hoped this\r\neloquent appeal would cleave a road their strugglings could not open.\r\nThe very Chinamen and Indians caught the excitement and dashed their half\r\ndollars into the cart without knowing or caring what it was all about.\r\nWomen plunged into the crowd, trimly attired, fought their way to the\r\ncart with their coin, and emerged again, by and by, with their apparel in\r\na state of hopeless dilapidation.  It was the wildest mob Virginia had\r\never seen and the most determined and ungovernable; and when at last it\r\nabated its fury and dispersed, it had not a penny in its pocket.\r\n\r\nTo use its own phraseology, it came there "flush" and went away "busted."\r\n\r\nAfter that, the Commission got itself into systematic working order, and\r\nfor weeks the contributions flowed into its treasury in a generous\r\nstream.  Individuals and all sorts of organizations levied upon\r\nthemselves a regular weekly tax for the sanitary fund, graduated\r\naccording to their means, and there was not another grand universal\r\noutburst till the famous "Sanitary Flour Sack" came our way.  Its history\r\nis peculiar and interesting.  A former schoolmate of mine, by the name of\r\nReuel Gridley, was living at the little city of Austin, in the Reese\r\nriver country, at this time, and was the Democratic candidate for mayor.\r\nHe and the Republican candidate made an agreement that the defeated man\r\nshould be publicly presented with a fifty-pound sack of flour by the\r\nsuccessful one, and should carry it home on his shoulder.  Gridley was\r\ndefeated.  The new mayor gave him the sack of flour, and he shouldered it\r\nand carried it a mile or two, from Lower Austin to his home in Upper\r\nAustin, attended by a band of music and the whole population.  Arrived\r\nthere, he said he did not need the flour, and asked what the people\r\nthought he had better do with it.  A voice said:\r\n\r\n"Sell it to the highest bidder, for the benefit of the Sanitary fund."\r\n\r\nThe suggestion was greeted with a round of applause, and Gridley mounted\r\na dry-goods box and assumed the role of auctioneer.  The bids went higher\r\nand higher, as the sympathies of the pioneers awoke and expanded, till at\r\nlast the sack was knocked down to a mill man at two hundred and fifty\r\ndollars, and his check taken.  He was asked where he would have the flour\r\ndelivered, and he said:\r\n\r\n"Nowhere--sell it again."\r\n\r\nNow the cheers went up royally, and the multitude were fairly in the\r\nspirit of the thing.  So Gridley stood there and shouted and perspired\r\ntill the sun went down; and when the crowd dispersed he had sold the sack\r\nto three hundred different people, and had taken in eight thousand\r\ndollars in gold.  And still the flour sack was in his possession.\r\n\r\nThe news came to Virginia, and a telegram went back:\r\n\r\n"Fetch along your flour sack!"\r\n\r\nThirty-six hours afterward Gridley arrived, and an afternoon mass meeting\r\nwas held in the Opera House, and the auction began.  But the sack had\r\ncome sooner than it was expected; the people were not thoroughly aroused,\r\nand the sale dragged.  At nightfall only five thousand dollars had been\r\nsecured, and there was a crestfallen feeling in the community.  However,\r\nthere was no disposition to let the matter rest here and acknowledge\r\nvanquishment at the hands of the village of Austin.  Till late in the\r\nnight the principal citizens were at work arranging the morrow\'s\r\ncampaign, and when they went to bed they had no fears for the result.\r\nAt eleven the next morning a procession of open carriages, attended by\r\nclamorous bands of music and adorned with a moving display of flags,\r\nfiled along C street and was soon in danger of blockade by a huzzaing\r\nmultitude of citizens.  In the first carriage sat Gridley, with the flour\r\nsack in prominent view, the latter splendid with bright paint and gilt\r\nlettering; also in the same carriage sat the mayor and the recorder.\r\nThe other carriages contained the Common Council, the editors and\r\nreporters, and other people of imposing consequence.  The crowd pressed\r\nto the corner of C and Taylor streets, expecting the sale to begin there,\r\nbut they were disappointed, and also unspeakably surprised; for the\r\ncavalcade moved on as if Virginia had ceased to be of importance, and\r\ntook its way over the "divide," toward the small town of Gold Hill.\r\nTelegrams had gone ahead to Gold Hill, Silver City and Dayton, and those\r\ncommunities were at fever heat and rife for the conflict.  It was a very\r\nhot day, and wonderfully dusty.  At the end of a short half hour we\r\ndescended into Gold Hill with drums beating and colors flying, and\r\nenveloped in imposing clouds of dust.  The whole population--men, women\r\nand children, Chinamen and Indians, were massed in the main street, all\r\nthe flags in town were at the mast head, and the blare of the bands was\r\ndrowned in cheers.  Gridley stood up and asked who would make the first\r\nbid for the National Sanitary Flour Sack.  Gen. W. said:\r\n\r\n"The Yellow Jacket silver mining company offers a thousand dollars,\r\ncoin!"\r\n\r\nA tempest of applause followed.  A telegram carried the news to Virginia,\r\nand fifteen minutes afterward that city\'s population was massed in the\r\nstreets devouring the tidings--for it was part of the programme that the\r\nbulletin boards should do a good work that day.  Every few minutes a new\r\ndispatch was bulletined from Gold Hill, and still the excitement grew.\r\nTelegrams began to return to us from Virginia beseeching Gridley to bring\r\nback the flour sack; but such was not the plan of the campaign.  At the\r\nend of an hour Gold Hill\'s small population had paid a figure for the\r\nflour sack that awoke all the enthusiasm of Virginia when the grand total\r\nwas displayed upon the bulletin boards.  Then the Gridley cavalcade moved\r\non, a giant refreshed with new lager beer and plenty of it--for the\r\npeople brought it to the carriages without waiting to measure it--and\r\nwithin three hours more the expedition had carried Silver City and Dayton\r\nby storm and was on its way back covered with glory.  Every move had been\r\ntelegraphed and bulletined, and as the procession entered Virginia and\r\nfiled down C street at half past eight in the evening the town was abroad\r\nin the thoroughfares, torches were glaring, flags flying, bands playing,\r\ncheer on cheer cleaving the air, and the city ready to surrender at\r\ndiscretion.  The auction began, every bid was greeted with bursts of\r\napplause, and at the end of two hours and a half a population of fifteen\r\nthousand souls had paid in coin for a fifty-pound sack of flour a sum\r\nequal to forty thousand dollars in greenbacks!  It was at a rate in the\r\nneighborhood of three dollars for each man, woman and child of the\r\npopulation.  The grand total would have been twice as large, but the\r\nstreets were very narrow, and hundreds who wanted to bid could not get\r\nwithin a block of the stand, and could not make themselves heard.  These\r\ngrew tired of waiting and many of them went home long before the auction\r\nwas over.  This was the greatest day Virginia ever saw, perhaps.\r\n\r\nGridley sold the sack in Carson city and several California towns; also\r\nin San Francisco.  Then he took it east and sold it in one or two\r\nAtlantic cities, I think.  I am not sure of that, but I know that he\r\nfinally carried it to St. Louis, where a monster Sanitary Fair was being\r\nheld, and after selling it there for a large sum and helping on the\r\nenthusiasm by displaying the portly silver bricks which Nevada\'s donation\r\nhad produced, he had the flour baked up into small cakes and retailed\r\nthem at high prices.\r\n\r\nIt was estimated that when the flour sack\'s mission was ended it had been\r\nsold for a grand total of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in\r\ngreenbacks!  This is probably the only instance on record where common\r\nfamily flour brought three thousand dollars a pound in the public market.\r\n\r\nIt is due to Mr. Gridley\'s memory to mention that the expenses of his\r\nsanitary flour sack expedition of fifteen thousand miles, going and\r\nreturning, were paid in large part if not entirely, out of his own\r\npocket.  The time he gave to it was not less than three months.\r\nMr. Gridley was a soldier in the Mexican war and a pioneer Californian.\r\nHe died at Stockton, California, in December, 1870, greatly regretted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nThere were nabobs in those days--in the "flush times," I mean.  Every\r\nrich strike in the mines created one or two.  I call to mind several of\r\nthese.  They were careless, easy-going fellows, as a general thing, and\r\nthe community at large was as much benefited by their riches as they were\r\nthemselves--possibly more, in some cases.\r\n\r\nTwo cousins, teamsters, did some hauling for a man and had to take a\r\nsmall segregated portion of a silver mine in lieu of $300 cash.  They\r\ngave an outsider a third to open the mine, and they went on teaming.  But\r\nnot long.  Ten months afterward the mine was out of debt and paying each\r\nowner $8,000 to $10,000 a month--say $100,000 a year.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest nabobs that Nevada was delivered of wore $6,000 worth\r\nof diamonds in his bosom, and swore he was unhappy because he could not\r\nspend his money as fast as he made it.\r\n\r\nAnother Nevada nabob boasted an income that often reached $16,000 a\r\nmonth; and he used to love to tell how he had worked in the very mine\r\nthat yielded it, for five dollars a day, when he first came to the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe silver and sage-brush State has knowledge of another of these pets of\r\nfortune--lifted from actual poverty to affluence almost in a single\r\nnight--who was able to offer $100,000 for a position of high official\r\ndistinction, shortly afterward, and did offer it--but failed to get it,\r\nhis politics not being as sound as his bank account.\r\n\r\nThen there was John Smith.  He was a good, honest, kind-hearted soul,\r\nborn and reared in the lower ranks of life, and miraculously ignorant.\r\nHe drove a team, and owned a small ranch--a ranch that paid him a\r\ncomfortable living, for although it yielded but little hay, what little\r\nit did yield was worth from $250 to $300 in gold per ton in the market.\r\nPresently Smith traded a few acres of the ranch for a small undeveloped\r\nsilver mine in Gold Hill.  He opened the mine and built a little\r\nunpretending ten-stamp mill.  Eighteen months afterward he retired from\r\nthe hay business, for his mining income had reached a most comfortable\r\nfigure.  Some people said it was $30,000 a month, and others said it was\r\n$60,000.  Smith was very rich at any rate.\r\n\r\nAnd then he went to Europe and traveled.  And when he came back he was\r\nnever tired of telling about the fine hogs he had seen in England, and\r\nthe gorgeous sheep he had seen in Spain, and the fine cattle he had\r\nnoticed in the vicinity of Rome.  He was full of wonders of the old\r\nworld, and advised everybody to travel.  He said a man never imagined\r\nwhat surprising things there were in the world till he had traveled.\r\n\r\nOne day, on board ship, the passengers made up a pool of $500, which was\r\nto be the property of the man who should come nearest to guessing the run\r\nof the vessel for the next twenty-four hours.  Next day, toward noon, the\r\nfigures were all in the purser\'s hands in sealed envelopes.  Smith was\r\nserene and happy, for he had been bribing the engineer.  But another\r\nparty won the prize!  Smith said:\r\n\r\n"Here, that won\'t do!  He guessed two miles wider of the mark than I did."\r\n\r\nThe purser said, "Mr. Smith, you missed it further than any man on board.\r\nWe traveled two hundred and eight miles yesterday."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir," said Smith, "that\'s just where I\'ve got you, for I guessed\r\ntwo hundred and nine.  If you\'ll look at my figgers again you\'ll find a 2\r\nand two 0\'s, which stands for 200, don\'t it?--and after \'em you\'ll find a\r\n9 (2009), which stands for two hundred and nine.  I reckon I\'ll take that\r\nmoney, if you please."\r\n\r\nThe Gould & Curry claim comprised twelve hundred feet, and it all\r\nbelonged originally to the two men whose names it bears.  Mr. Curry owned\r\ntwo thirds of it--and he said that he sold it out for twenty-five hundred\r\ndollars in cash, and an old plug horse that ate up his market value in\r\nhay and barley in seventeen days by the watch.  And he said that Gould\r\nsold out for a pair of second-hand government blankets and a bottle of\r\nwhisky that killed nine men in three hours, and that an unoffending\r\nstranger that smelt the cork was disabled for life.  Four years afterward\r\nthe mine thus disposed of was worth in the San Francisco market seven\r\nmillions six hundred thousand dollars in gold coin.\r\n\r\nIn the early days a poverty-stricken Mexican who lived in a canyon\r\ndirectly back of Virginia City, had a stream of water as large as a man\'s\r\nwrist trickling from the hill-side on his premises.  The Ophir Company\r\nsegregated a hundred feet of their mine and traded it to him for the\r\nstream of water.  The hundred feet proved to be the richest part of the\r\nentire mine; four years after the swap, its market value (including its\r\nmill) was $1,500,000.\r\n\r\nAn individual who owned twenty feet in the Ophir mine before its great\r\nriches were revealed to men, traded it for a horse, and a very sorry\r\nlooking brute he was, too.  A year or so afterward, when Ophir stock went\r\nup to $3,000 a foot, this man, who had not a cent, used to say he was the\r\nmost startling example of magnificence and misery the world had ever\r\nseen--because he was able to ride a sixty-thousand-dollar horse--yet\r\ncould not scrape up cash enough to buy a saddle, and was obliged to\r\nborrow one or ride bareback.  He said if fortune were to give him another\r\nsixty-thousand-dollar horse it would ruin him.\r\n\r\nA youth of nineteen, who was a telegraph operator in Virginia on a salary\r\nof a hundred dollars a month, and who, when he could not make out German\r\nnames in the list of San Francisco steamer arrivals, used to ingeniously\r\nselect and supply substitutes for them out of an old Berlin city\r\ndirectory, made himself rich by watching the mining telegrams that passed\r\nthrough his hands and buying and selling stocks accordingly, through a\r\nfriend in San Francisco.  Once when a private dispatch was sent from\r\nVirginia announcing a rich strike in a prominent mine and advising that\r\nthe matter be kept secret till a large amount of the stock could be\r\nsecured, he bought forty "feet" of the stock at twenty dollars a foot,\r\nand afterward sold half of it at eight hundred dollars a foot and the\r\nrest at double that figure.  Within three months he was worth $150,000,\r\nand had resigned his telegraphic position.\r\n\r\nAnother telegraph operator who had been discharged by the company for\r\ndivulging the secrets of the office, agreed with a moneyed man in San\r\nFrancisco to furnish him the result of a great Virginia mining lawsuit\r\nwithin an hour after its private reception by the parties to it in San\r\nFrancisco.  For this he was to have a large percentage of the profits on\r\npurchases and sales made on it by his fellow-conspirator.  So he went,\r\ndisguised as a teamster, to a little wayside telegraph office in the\r\nmountains, got acquainted with the operator, and sat in the office day\r\nafter day, smoking his pipe, complaining that his team was fagged out and\r\nunable to travel--and meantime listening to the dispatches as they passed\r\nclicking through the machine from Virginia.  Finally the private dispatch\r\nannouncing the result of the lawsuit sped over the wires, and as soon as\r\nhe heard it he telegraphed his friend in San Francisco:\r\n\r\n"Am tired waiting.  Shall sell the team and go home."\r\n\r\nIt was the signal agreed upon.  The word "waiting" left out, would have\r\nsignified that the suit had gone the other way.\r\n\r\nThe mock teamster\'s friend picked up a deal of the mining stock, at low\r\nfigures, before the news became public, and a fortune was the result.\r\n\r\nFor a long time after one of the great Virginia mines had been\r\nincorporated, about fifty feet of the original location were still in the\r\nhands of a man who had never signed the incorporation papers.  The stock\r\nbecame very valuable, and every effort was made to find this man, but he\r\nhad disappeared.  Once it was heard that he was in New York, and one or\r\ntwo speculators went east but failed to find him.  Once the news came\r\nthat he was in the Bermudas, and straightway a speculator or two hurried\r\neast and sailed for Bermuda--but he was not there.  Finally he was heard\r\nof in Mexico, and a friend of his, a bar-keeper on a salary, scraped\r\ntogether a little money and sought him out, bought his "feet" for a\r\nhundred dollars, returned and sold the property for $75,000.\r\n\r\nBut why go on?  The traditions of Silverland are filled with instances\r\nlike these, and I would never get through enumerating them were I to\r\nattempt do it.  I only desired to give, the reader an idea of a\r\npeculiarity of the "flush times" which I could not present so strikingly\r\nin any other way, and which some mention of was necessary to a realizing\r\ncomprehension of the time and the country.\r\n\r\nI was personally acquainted with the majority of the nabobs I have\r\nreferred to, and so, for old acquaintance sake, I have shifted their\r\noccupations and experiences around in such a way as to keep the Pacific\r\npublic from recognizing these once notorious men.  No longer notorious,\r\nfor the majority of them have drifted back into poverty and obscurity\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIn Nevada there used to be current the story of an adventure of two of\r\nher nabobs, which may or may not have occurred.  I give it for what it is\r\nworth:\r\n\r\nCol. Jim had seen somewhat of the world, and knew more or less of its\r\nways; but Col. Jack was from the back settlements of the States, had led\r\na life of arduous toil, and had never seen a city.  These two, blessed\r\nwith sudden wealth, projected a visit to New York,--Col. Jack to see the\r\nsights, and Col. Jim to guard his unsophistication from misfortune.  They\r\nreached San Francisco in the night, and sailed in the morning.  Arrived\r\nin New York, Col.  Jack said:\r\n\r\n"I\'ve heard tell of carriages all my life, and now I mean to have a ride\r\nin one; I don\'t care what it costs.  Come along."\r\n\r\nThey stepped out on the sidewalk, and Col. Jim called a stylish barouche.\r\nBut Col. Jack said:\r\n\r\n"No, sir!  None of your cheap-John turn-outs for me.  I\'m here to have a\r\ngood time, and money ain\'t any object.  I mean to have the nobbiest rig\r\nthat\'s going.  Now here comes the very trick.  Stop that yaller one with\r\nthe pictures on it--don\'t you fret--I\'ll stand all the expenses myself."\r\n\r\nSo Col. Jim stopped an empty omnibus, and they got in.  Said Col. Jack:\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t it gay, though?  Oh, no, I reckon not!  Cushions, and windows, and\r\npictures, till you can\'t rest.  What would the boys say if they could see\r\nus cutting a swell like this in New York?  By George, I wish they could\r\nsee us."\r\n\r\nThen he put his head out of the window, and shouted to the driver:\r\n\r\n"Say, Johnny, this suits me!--suits yours truly, you bet, you!  I want\r\nthis shebang all day.  I\'m on it, old man!  Let \'em out!  Make \'em go!\r\nWe\'ll make it all right with you, sonny!"\r\n\r\nThe driver passed his hand through the strap-hole, and tapped for his\r\nfare--it was before the gongs came into common use.  Col. Jack took the\r\nhand, and shook it cordially.  He said:\r\n\r\n"You twig me, old pard!  All right between gents.  Smell of that, and see\r\nhow you like it!"\r\n\r\nAnd he put a twenty-dollar gold piece in the driver\'s hand.  After a\r\nmoment the driver said he could not make change.\r\n\r\n"Bother the change!  Ride it out.  Put it in your pocket."\r\n\r\nThen to Col.  Jim, with a sounding slap on his thigh:\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t it style, though?  Hanged if I don\'t hire this thing every day for\r\na week."\r\n\r\nThe omnibus stopped, and a young lady got in.  Col. Jack stared a moment,\r\nthen nudged Col. Jim with his elbow:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say a word," he whispered.  "Let her ride, if she wants to.\r\nGracious, there\'s room enough."\r\n\r\nThe young lady got out her porte-monnaie, and handed her fare to Col.\r\nJack.\r\n\r\n"What\'s this for?"  said he.\r\n\r\n"Give it to the driver, please."\r\n\r\n"Take back your money, madam.  We can\'t allow it.  You\'re welcome to ride\r\nhere as long as you please, but this shebang\'s chartered, and we can\'t\r\nlet you pay a cent."\r\n\r\nThe girl shrunk into a corner, bewildered.  An old lady with a basket\r\nclimbed in, and proffered her fare.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me," said Col. Jack.  "You\'re perfectly welcome here, madam, but\r\nwe can\'t allow you to pay.  Set right down there, mum, and don\'t you be\r\nthe least uneasy.  Make yourself just as free as if you was in your own\r\nturn-out."\r\n\r\nWithin two minutes, three gentlemen, two fat women, and a couple of\r\nchildren, entered.\r\n\r\n"Come right along, friends," said Col.  Jack; "don\'t mind us.  This is a\r\nfree blow-out."  Then he whispered to Col.  Jim,\r\n\r\n"New York ain\'t no sociable place, I don\'t reckon--it ain\'t no name for\r\nit!"\r\n\r\nHe resisted every effort to pass fares to the driver, and made everybody\r\ncordially welcome.  The situation dawned on the people, and they pocketed\r\ntheir money, and delivered themselves up to covert enjoyment of the\r\nepisode.  Half a dozen more passengers entered.\r\n\r\n"Oh, there\'s plenty of room," said Col.  Jack.  "Walk right in, and make\r\nyourselves at home.  A blow-out ain\'t worth anything as a blow-out,\r\nunless a body has company."  Then in a whisper to Col.  Jim: "But ain\'t\r\nthese New Yorkers friendly?  And ain\'t they cool about it, too?  Icebergs\r\nain\'t anywhere.  I reckon they\'d tackle a hearse, if it was going their\r\nway."\r\n\r\nMore passengers got in; more yet, and still more.  Both seats were\r\nfilled, and a file of men were standing up, holding on to the cleats\r\noverhead.  Parties with baskets and bundles were climbing up on the roof.\r\nHalf-suppressed laughter rippled up from all sides.\r\n\r\n"Well, for clean, cool, out-and-out cheek, if this don\'t bang anything\r\nthat ever I saw, I\'m an Injun!" whispered Col. Jack.\r\n\r\nA Chinaman crowded his way in.\r\n\r\n"I weaken!" said Col. Jack.  "Hold on, driver!  Keep your seats, ladies,\r\nand gents.  Just make yourselves free--everything\'s paid for.  Driver,\r\nrustle these folks around as long as they\'re a mind to go--friends of\r\nours, you know.  Take them everywheres--and if you want more money, come\r\nto the St. Nicholas, and we\'ll make it all right.  Pleasant journey to\r\nyou, ladies and gents--go it just as long as you please--it shan\'t cost\r\nyou a cent!"\r\n\r\nThe two comrades got out, and Col. Jack said:\r\n\r\n"Jimmy, it\'s the sociablest place I ever saw.  The Chinaman waltzed in as\r\ncomfortable as anybody.  If we\'d staid awhile, I reckon we\'d had some\r\nniggers.  B\' George, we\'ll have to barricade our doors to-night, or some\r\nof these ducks will be trying to sleep with us."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nSomebody has said that in order to know a community, one must observe the\r\nstyle of its funerals and know what manner of men they bury with most\r\nceremony.  I cannot say which class we buried with most eclat in our\r\n"flush times," the distinguished public benefactor or the distinguished\r\nrough--possibly the two chief grades or grand divisions of society\r\nhonored their illustrious dead about equally; and hence, no doubt the\r\nphilosopher I have quoted from would have needed to see two\r\nrepresentative funerals in Virginia before forming his estimate of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThere was a grand time over Buck Fanshaw when he died.  He was a\r\nrepresentative citizen.  He had "killed his man"--not in his own quarrel,\r\nit is true, but in defence of a stranger unfairly beset by numbers.\r\nHe had kept a sumptuous saloon.  He had been the proprietor of a dashing\r\nhelpmeet whom he could have discarded without the formality of a divorce.\r\nHe had held a high position in the fire department and been a very\r\nWarwick in politics.  When he died there was great lamentation throughout\r\nthe town, but especially in the vast bottom-stratum of society.\r\n\r\nOn the inquest it was shown that Buck Fanshaw, in the delirium of a\r\nwasting typhoid fever, had taken arsenic, shot himself through the body,\r\ncut his throat, and jumped out of a four-story window and broken his\r\nneck--and after due deliberation, the jury, sad and tearful, but with\r\nintelligence unblinded by its sorrow, brought in a verdict of death "by\r\nthe visitation of God."  What could the world do without juries?\r\n\r\nProdigious preparations were made for the funeral.  All the vehicles in\r\ntown were hired, all the saloons put in mourning, all the municipal and\r\nfire-company flags hung at half-mast, and all the firemen ordered to\r\nmuster in uniform and bring their machines duly draped in black.  Now\r\n--let us remark in parenthesis--as all the peoples of the earth had\r\nrepresentative adventurers in the Silverland, and as each adventurer had\r\nbrought the slang of his nation or his locality with him, the combination\r\nmade the slang of Nevada the richest and the most infinitely varied and\r\ncopious that had ever existed anywhere in the world, perhaps, except in\r\nthe mines of California in the "early days."  Slang was the language of\r\nNevada.  It was hard to preach a sermon without it, and be understood.\r\nSuch phrases as "You bet!"  "Oh, no, I reckon not!"  "No Irish need\r\napply," and a hundred others, became so common as to fall from the lips\r\nof a speaker unconsciously--and very often when they did not touch the\r\nsubject under discussion and consequently failed to mean anything.\r\n\r\nAfter Buck Fanshaw\'s inquest, a meeting of the short-haired brotherhood\r\nwas held, for nothing can be done on the Pacific coast without a public\r\nmeeting and an expression of sentiment.  Regretful resolutions were\r\npassed and various committees appointed; among others, a committee of one\r\nwas deputed to call on the minister, a fragile, gentle, spiritual new\r\nfledgling from an Eastern theological seminary, and as yet unacquainted\r\nwith the ways of the mines.  The committeeman, "Scotty" Briggs, made his\r\nvisit; and in after days it was worth something to hear the minister tell\r\nabout it.  Scotty was a stalwart rough, whose customary suit, when on\r\nweighty official business, like committee work, was a fire helmet,\r\nflaming red flannel shirt, patent leather belt with spanner and revolver\r\nattached, coat hung over arm, and pants stuffed into boot tops.\r\nHe formed something of a contrast to the pale theological student.  It is\r\nfair to say of Scotty, however, in passing, that he had a warm heart, and\r\na strong love for his friends, and never entered into a quarrel when he\r\ncould reasonably keep out of it.  Indeed, it was commonly said that\r\nwhenever one of Scotty\'s fights was investigated, it always turned out\r\nthat it had originally been no affair of his, but that out of native\r\ngood-heartedness he had dropped in of his own accord to help the man who\r\nwas getting the worst of it.  He and Buck Fanshaw were bosom friends, for\r\nyears, and had often taken adventurous "pot-luck" together.  On one\r\noccasion, they had thrown off their coats and taken the weaker side in a\r\nfight among strangers, and after gaining a hard-earned victory, turned\r\nand found that the men they were helping had deserted early, and not only\r\nthat, but had stolen their coats and made off with them!  But to return\r\nto Scotty\'s visit to the minister.  He was on a sorrowful mission, now,\r\nand his face was the picture of woe.  Being admitted to the presence he\r\nsat down before the clergyman, placed his fire-hat on an unfinished\r\nmanuscript sermon under the minister\'s nose, took from it a red silk\r\nhandkerchief, wiped his brow and heaved a sigh of dismal impressiveness,\r\nexplanatory of his business.\r\n\r\nHe choked, and even shed tears; but with an effort he mastered his voice\r\nand said in lugubrious tones:\r\n\r\n"Are you the duck that runs the gospel-mill next door?"\r\n\r\n"Am I the--pardon me, I believe I do not understand?"\r\n\r\nWith another sigh and a half-sob, Scotty rejoined:\r\n\r\n"Why you see we are in a bit of trouble, and the boys thought maybe you\r\nwould give us a lift, if we\'d tackle you--that is, if I\'ve got the rights\r\nof it and you are the head clerk of the doxology-works next door."\r\n\r\n"I am the shepherd in charge of the flock whose fold is next door."\r\n\r\n"The which?"\r\n\r\n"The spiritual adviser of the little company of believers whose sanctuary\r\nadjoins these premises."\r\n\r\nScotty scratched his head, reflected a moment, and then said:\r\n\r\n"You ruther hold over me, pard.  I reckon I can\'t call that hand.  Ante\r\nand pass the buck."\r\n\r\n"How? I beg pardon.  What did I understand you to say?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'ve ruther got the bulge on me.  Or maybe we\'ve both got the\r\nbulge, somehow.  You don\'t smoke me and I don\'t smoke you.  You see, one\r\nof the boys has passed in his checks and we want to give him a good\r\nsend-off, and so the thing I\'m on now is to roust out somebody to jerk\r\na little chin-music for us and waltz him through handsome."\r\n\r\n"My friend, I seem to grow more and more bewildered.  Your observations\r\nare wholly incomprehensible to me.  Cannot you simplify them in some way?\r\nAt first I thought perhaps I understood you, but I grope now.  Would it\r\nnot expedite matters if you restricted yourself to categorical statements\r\nof fact unencumbered with obstructing accumulations of metaphor and\r\nallegory?"\r\n\r\nAnother pause, and more reflection.  Then, said Scotty:\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have to pass, I judge."\r\n\r\n"How?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve raised me out, pard."\r\n\r\n"I still fail to catch your meaning."\r\n\r\n"Why, that last lead of yourn is too many for me--that\'s the idea.  I\r\ncan\'t neither-trump nor follow suit."\r\n\r\nThe clergyman sank back in his chair perplexed.  Scotty leaned his head\r\non his hand and gave himself up to thought.\r\n\r\nPresently his face came up, sorrowful but confident.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got it now, so\'s you can savvy," he said.  "What we want is a\r\ngospel-sharp.  See?"\r\n\r\n"A what?"\r\n\r\n"Gospel-sharp.  Parson."\r\n\r\n"Oh!  Why did you not say so before?  I am a clergyman--a parson."\r\n\r\n"Now you talk!  You see my blind and straddle it like a man.  Put it\r\nthere!"--extending a brawny paw, which closed over the minister\'s small\r\nhand and gave it a shake indicative of fraternal sympathy and fervent\r\ngratification.\r\n\r\n"Now we\'re all right, pard.  Let\'s start fresh.  Don\'t you mind my\r\nsnuffling a little--becuz we\'re in a power of trouble.  You see, one of\r\nthe boys has gone up the flume--"\r\n\r\n"Gone where?"\r\n\r\n"Up the flume--throwed up the sponge, you understand."\r\n\r\n"Thrown up the sponge?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--kicked the bucket--"\r\n\r\n"Ah--has departed to that mysterious country from whose bourne no\r\ntraveler returns."\r\n\r\n"Return!  I reckon not.  Why pard, he\'s dead!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I understand."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you do?  Well I thought maybe you might be getting tangled some\r\nmore.  Yes, you see he\'s dead again--"\r\n\r\n"Again?  Why, has he ever been dead before?"\r\n\r\n"Dead before?  No!  Do you reckon a man has got as many lives as a cat?\r\nBut you bet you he\'s awful dead now, poor old boy, and I wish I\'d never\r\nseen this day.  I don\'t want no better friend than Buck Fanshaw.\r\nI knowed him by the back; and when I know a man and like him, I freeze to\r\nhim--you hear me.  Take him all round, pard, there never was a bullier\r\nman in the mines.  No man ever knowed Buck Fanshaw to go back on a\r\nfriend.  But it\'s all up, you know, it\'s all up.  It ain\'t no use.\r\nThey\'ve scooped him."\r\n\r\n"Scooped him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--death has.  Well, well, well, we\'ve got to give him up.  Yes\r\nindeed.  It\'s a kind of a hard world, after all, ain\'t it?  But pard, he\r\nwas a rustler!  You ought to seen him get started once.  He was a bully\r\nboy with a glass eye!  Just spit in his face and give him room according\r\nto his strength, and it was just beautiful to see him peel and go in.\r\nHe was the worst son of a thief that ever drawed breath.  Pard, he was on\r\nit!  He was on it bigger than an Injun!"\r\n\r\n"On it?  On what?"\r\n\r\n"On the shoot.  On the shoulder.  On the fight, you understand.\r\nHe didn\'t give a continental for any body.  Beg your pardon, friend, for\r\ncoming so near saying a cuss-word--but you see I\'m on an awful strain, in\r\nthis palaver, on account of having to cramp down and draw everything so\r\nmild.  But we\'ve got to give him up.  There ain\'t any getting around\r\nthat, I don\'t reckon.  Now if we can get you to help plant him--"\r\n\r\n"Preach the funeral discourse?  Assist at the obsequies?"\r\n\r\n"Obs\'quies is good.  Yes.  That\'s it--that\'s our little game.  We are\r\ngoing to get the thing up regardless, you know.  He was always nifty\r\nhimself, and so you bet you his funeral ain\'t going to be no slouch\r\n--solid silver door-plate on his coffin, six plumes on the hearse, and a\r\nnigger on the box in a biled shirt and a plug hat--how\'s that for high?\r\nAnd we\'ll take care of you, pard.  We\'ll fix you all right.  There\'ll be\r\na kerridge for you; and whatever you want, you just \'scape out and we\'ll\r\n\'tend to it.  We\'ve got a shebang fixed up for you to stand behind, in\r\nNo. 1\'s house, and don\'t you be afraid.  Just go in and toot your horn,\r\nif you don\'t sell a clam.  Put Buck through as bully as you can, pard,\r\nfor anybody that knowed him will tell you that he was one of the whitest\r\nmen that was ever in the mines.  You can\'t draw it too strong.  He never\r\ncould stand it to see things going wrong.  He\'s done more to make this\r\ntown quiet and peaceable than any man in it.  I\'ve seen him lick four\r\nGreasers in eleven minutes, myself.  If a thing wanted regulating, he\r\nwarn\'t a man to go browsing around after somebody to do it, but he would\r\nprance in and regulate it himself.  He warn\'t a Catholic.  Scasely.  He\r\nwas down on \'em.  His word was, \'No Irish need apply!\'  But it didn\'t\r\nmake no difference about that when it came down to what a man\'s rights\r\nwas--and so, when some roughs jumped the Catholic bone-yard and started\r\nin to stake out town-lots in it he went for \'em!  And he cleaned \'em,\r\ntoo!  I was there, pard, and I seen it myself."\r\n\r\n"That was very well indeed--at least the impulse was--whether the act was\r\nstrictly defensible or not.  Had deceased any religious convictions?\r\nThat is to say, did he feel a dependence upon, or acknowledge allegiance\r\nto a higher power?"\r\n\r\nMore reflection.\r\n\r\n"I reckon you\'ve stumped me again, pard.  Could you say it over once\r\nmore, and say it slow?"\r\n\r\n"Well, to simplify it somewhat, was he, or rather had he ever been\r\nconnected with any organization sequestered from secular concerns and\r\ndevoted to self-sacrifice in the interests of morality?"\r\n\r\n"All down but nine--set \'em up on the other alley, pard."\r\n\r\n"What did I understand you to say?"\r\n\r\n"Why, you\'re most too many for me, you know.  When you get in with your\r\nleft I hunt grass every time.  Every time you draw, you fill; but I don\'t\r\nseem to have any luck.  Lets have a new deal."\r\n\r\n"How?  Begin again?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s it."\r\n\r\n"Very well.  Was he a good man, and--"\r\n\r\n"There--I see that; don\'t put up another chip till I look at my hand.\r\nA good man, says you?  Pard, it ain\'t no name for it.  He was the best\r\nman that ever--pard, you would have doted on that man.  He could lam any\r\ngaloot of his inches in America.  It was him that put down the riot last\r\nelection before it got a start; and everybody said he was the only man\r\nthat could have done it.  He waltzed in with a spanner in one hand and a\r\ntrumpet in the other, and sent fourteen men home on a shutter in less\r\nthan three minutes.  He had that riot all broke up and prevented nice\r\nbefore anybody ever got a chance to strike a blow.  He was always for\r\npeace, and he would have peace--he could not stand disturbances.  Pard,\r\nhe was a great loss to this town.  It would please the boys if you could\r\nchip in something like that and do him justice.  Here once when the Micks\r\ngot to throwing stones through the Methodis\' Sunday school windows, Buck\r\nFanshaw, all of his own notion, shut up his saloon and took a couple of\r\nsix-shooters and mounted guard over the Sunday school.  Says he, \'No\r\nIrish need apply!\'  And they didn\'t.  He was the bulliest man in the\r\nmountains, pard!  He could run faster, jump higher, hit harder, and hold\r\nmore tangle-foot whisky without spilling it than any man in seventeen\r\ncounties.  Put that in, pard--it\'ll please the boys more than anything\r\nyou could say.  And you can say, pard, that he never shook his mother."\r\n\r\n"Never shook his mother?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s it--any of the boys will tell you so."\r\n\r\n"Well, but why should he shake her?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I say--but some people does."\r\n\r\n"Not people of any repute?"\r\n\r\n"Well, some that averages pretty so-so."\r\n\r\n"In my opinion the man that would offer personal violence to his own\r\nmother, ought to--"\r\n\r\n"Cheese it, pard; you\'ve banked your ball clean outside the string.\r\nWhat I was a drivin\' at, was, that he never throwed off on his mother\r\n--don\'t you see?  No indeedy.  He give her a house to live in, and town\r\nlots, and plenty of money; and he looked after her and took care of her\r\nall the time; and when she was down with the small-pox I\'m d---d if he\r\ndidn\'t set up nights and nuss her himself!  Beg your pardon for saying\r\nit, but it hopped out too quick for yours truly.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve treated me like a gentleman, pard, and I ain\'t the man to hurt\r\nyour feelings intentional.  I think you\'re white.  I think you\'re a\r\nsquare man, pard.  I like you, and I\'ll lick any man that don\'t.  I\'ll\r\nlick him till he can\'t tell himself from a last year\'s corpse!  Put it\r\nthere!" [Another fraternal hand-shake--and exit.]\r\n\r\nThe obsequies were all that "the boys" could desire.  Such a marvel of\r\nfuneral pomp had never been seen in Virginia.  The plumed hearse, the\r\ndirge-breathing brass bands, the closed marts of business, the flags\r\ndrooping at half mast, the long, plodding procession of uniformed secret\r\nsocieties, military battalions and fire companies, draped engines,\r\ncarriages of officials, and citizens in vehicles and on foot, attracted\r\nmultitudes of spectators to the sidewalks, roofs and windows; and for\r\nyears afterward, the degree of grandeur attained by any civic display in\r\nVirginia was determined by comparison with Buck Fanshaw\'s funeral.\r\n\r\nScotty Briggs, as a pall-bearer and a mourner, occupied a prominent place\r\nat the funeral, and when the sermon was finished and the last sentence of\r\nthe prayer for the dead man\'s soul ascended, he responded, in a low\r\nvoice, but with feelings:\r\n\r\n"AMEN.  No Irish need apply."\r\n\r\nAs the bulk of the response was without apparent relevancy, it was\r\nprobably nothing more than a humble tribute to the memory of the friend\r\nthat was gone; for, as Scotty had once said, it was "his word."\r\n\r\nScotty Briggs, in after days, achieved the distinction of becoming the\r\nonly convert to religion that was ever gathered from the Virginia roughs;\r\nand it transpired that the man who had it in him to espouse the quarrel\r\nof the weak out of inborn nobility of spirit was no mean timber whereof\r\nto construct a Christian.  The making him one did not warp his generosity\r\nor diminish his courage; on the contrary it gave intelligent direction to\r\nthe one and a broader field to the other.\r\n\r\nIf his Sunday-school class progressed faster than the other classes, was\r\nit matter for wonder?  I think not.  He talked to his pioneer small-fry\r\nin a language they understood!  It was my large privilege, a month before\r\nhe died, to hear him tell the beautiful story of Joseph and his brethren\r\nto his class "without looking at the book."  I leave it to the reader to\r\nfancy what it was like, as it fell, riddled with slang, from the lips of\r\nthat grave, earnest teacher, and was listened to by his little learners\r\nwith a consuming interest that showed that they were as unconscious as he\r\nwas that any violence was being done to the sacred proprieties!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nThe first twenty-six graves in the Virginia cemetery were occupied by\r\nmurdered men.  So everybody said, so everybody believed, and so they will\r\nalways say and believe.  The reason why there was so much slaughtering\r\ndone, was, that in a new mining district the rough element predominates,\r\nand a person is not respected until he has "killed his man."  That was\r\nthe very expression used.\r\n\r\nIf an unknown individual arrived, they did not inquire if he was capable,\r\nhonest, industrious, but--had he killed his man?  If he had not, he\r\ngravitated to his natural and proper position, that of a man of small\r\nconsequence; if he had, the cordiality of his reception was graduated\r\naccording to the number of his dead.  It was tedious work struggling up\r\nto a position of influence with bloodless hands; but when a man came with\r\nthe blood of half a dozen men on his soul, his worth was recognized at\r\nonce and his acquaintance sought.\r\n\r\nIn Nevada, for a time, the lawyer, the editor, the banker, the chief\r\ndesperado, the chief gambler, and the saloon keeper, occupied the same\r\nlevel in society, and it was the highest.  The cheapest and easiest way\r\nto become an influential man and be looked up to by the community at\r\nlarge, was to stand behind a bar, wear a cluster-diamond pin, and sell\r\nwhisky.  I am not sure but that the saloon-keeper held a shade higher\r\nrank than any other member of society.  His opinion had weight.  It was\r\nhis privilege to say how the elections should go.  No great movement\r\ncould succeed without the countenance and direction of the\r\nsaloon-keepers.  It was a high favor when the chief saloon-keeper\r\nconsented to serve in the legislature or the board of aldermen.\r\n\r\nYouthful ambition hardly aspired so much to the honors of the law, or the\r\narmy and navy as to the dignity of proprietorship in a saloon.\r\n\r\nTo be a saloon-keeper and kill a man was to be illustrious.  Hence the\r\nreader will not be surprised to learn that more than one man was killed\r\nin Nevada under hardly the pretext of provocation, so impatient was the\r\nslayer to achieve reputation and throw off the galling sense of being\r\nheld in indifferent repute by his associates.  I knew two youths who\r\ntried to "kill their men" for no other reason--and got killed themselves\r\nfor their pains.  "There goes the man that killed Bill Adams" was higher\r\npraise and a sweeter sound in the ears of this sort of people than any\r\nother speech that admiring lips could utter.\r\n\r\nThe men who murdered Virginia\'s original twenty-six cemetery-occupants\r\nwere never punished.  Why?  Because Alfred the Great, when he invented\r\ntrial by jury and knew that he had admirably framed it to secure justice\r\nin his age of the world, was not aware that in the nineteenth century the\r\ncondition of things would be so entirely changed that unless he rose from\r\nthe grave and altered the jury plan to meet the emergency, it would prove\r\nthe most ingenious and infallible agency for defeating justice that human\r\nwisdom could contrive.  For how could he imagine that we simpletons would\r\ngo on using his jury plan after circumstances had stripped it of its\r\nusefulness, any more than he could imagine that we would go on using his\r\ncandle-clock after we had invented chronometers?  In his day news could\r\nnot travel fast, and hence he could easily find a jury of honest,\r\nintelligent men who had not heard of the case they were called to try\r\n--but in our day of telegraphs and newspapers his plan compels us to swear\r\nin juries composed of fools and rascals, because the system rigidly\r\nexcludes honest men and men of brains.\r\n\r\nI remember one of those sorrowful farces, in Virginia, which we call a\r\njury trial.  A noted desperado killed Mr. B., a good citizen, in the most\r\nwanton and cold-blooded way.  Of course the papers were full of it, and\r\nall men capable of reading, read about it.  And of course all men not\r\ndeaf and dumb and idiotic, talked about it.  A jury-list was made out,\r\nand Mr. B. L., a prominent banker and a valued citizen, was questioned\r\nprecisely as he would have been questioned in any court in America:\r\n\r\n"Have you heard of this homicide?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Have you held conversations upon the subject?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Have you formed or expressed opinions about it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Have you read the newspaper accounts of it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"We do not want you."\r\n\r\nA minister, intelligent, esteemed, and greatly respected; a merchant of\r\nhigh character and known probity; a mining superintendent of intelligence\r\nand unblemished reputation; a quartz mill owner of excellent standing,\r\nwere all questioned in the same way, and all set aside.  Each said the\r\npublic talk and the newspaper reports had not so biased his mind but that\r\nsworn testimony would overthrow his previously formed opinions and enable\r\nhim to render a verdict without prejudice and in accordance with the\r\nfacts.  But of course such men could not be trusted with the case.\r\nIgnoramuses alone could mete out unsullied justice.\r\n\r\nWhen the peremptory challenges were all exhausted, a jury of twelve men\r\nwas impaneled--a jury who swore they had neither heard, read, talked\r\nabout nor expressed an opinion concerning a murder which the very cattle\r\nin the corrals, the Indians in the sage-brush and the stones in the\r\nstreets were cognizant of!  It was a jury composed of two desperadoes,\r\ntwo low beer-house politicians, three bar-keepers, two ranchmen who could\r\nnot read, and three dull, stupid, human donkeys!  It actually came out\r\nafterward, that one of these latter thought that incest and arson were\r\nthe same thing.\r\n\r\nThe verdict rendered by this jury was, Not Guilty.  What else could one\r\nexpect?\r\n\r\nThe jury system puts a ban upon intelligence and honesty, and a premium\r\nupon ignorance, stupidity and perjury.  It is a shame that we must\r\ncontinue to use a worthless system because it was good a thousand years\r\nago.  In this age, when a gentleman of high social standing, intelligence\r\nand probity, swears that testimony given under solemn oath will outweigh,\r\nwith him, street talk and newspaper reports based upon mere hearsay, he\r\nis worth a hundred jurymen who will swear to their own ignorance and\r\nstupidity, and justice would be far safer in his hands than in theirs.\r\nWhy could not the jury law be so altered as to give men of brains and\r\nhonesty and equal chance with fools and miscreants?  Is it right to show\r\nthe present favoritism to one class of men and inflict a disability on\r\nanother, in a land whose boast is that all its citizens are free and\r\nequal?  I am a candidate for the legislature.  I desire to tamper with\r\nthe jury law.  I wish to so alter it as to put a premium on intelligence\r\nand character, and close the jury box against idiots, blacklegs, and\r\npeople who do not read newspapers.  But no doubt I shall be defeated\r\n--every effort I make to save the country "misses fire."\r\n\r\nMy idea, when I began this chapter, was to say something about\r\ndesperadoism in the "flush times" of Nevada.  To attempt a portrayal of\r\nthat era and that land, and leave out the blood and carnage, would be\r\nlike portraying Mormondom and leaving out polygamy.  The desperado\r\nstalked the streets with a swagger graded according to the number of his\r\nhomicides, and a nod of recognition from him was sufficient to make a\r\nhumble admirer happy for the rest of the day.  The deference that was\r\npaid to a desperado of wide reputation, and who "kept his private\r\ngraveyard," as the phrase went, was marked, and cheerfully accorded.\r\nWhen he moved along the sidewalk in his excessively long-tailed\r\nfrock-coat, shiny stump-toed boots, and with dainty little slouch hat\r\ntipped over left eye, the small-fry roughs made room for his majesty;\r\nwhen he entered the restaurant, the waiters deserted bankers and\r\nmerchants to overwhelm him with obsequious service; when he shouldered\r\nhis way to a bar, the shouldered parties wheeled indignantly, recognized\r\nhim, and--apologized.\r\n\r\nThey got a look in return that froze their marrow, and by that time a\r\ncurled and breast-pinned bar keeper was beaming over the counter, proud\r\nof the established acquaintanceship that permitted such a familiar form\r\nof speech as:\r\n\r\n"How\'re ye, Billy, old fel?  Glad to see you.  What\'ll you take--the old\r\nthing?"\r\n\r\nThe "old thing" meant his customary drink, of course.\r\n\r\nThe best known names in the Territory of Nevada were those belonging to\r\nthese long-tailed heroes of the revolver.  Orators, Governors,\r\ncapitalists and leaders of the legislature enjoyed a degree of fame, but\r\nit seemed local and meagre when contrasted with the fame of such men as\r\nSam Brown, Jack Williams, Billy Mulligan, Farmer Pease, Sugarfoot Mike,\r\nPock Marked Jake, El Dorado Johnny, Jack McNabb, Joe McGee, Jack Harris,\r\nSix-fingered Pete, etc., etc.  There was a long list of them.  They were\r\nbrave, reckless men, and traveled with their lives in their hands.  To\r\ngive them their due, they did their killing principally among themselves,\r\nand seldom molested peaceable citizens, for they considered it small\r\ncredit to add to their trophies so cheap a bauble as the death of a man\r\nwho was "not on the shoot," as they phrased it.  They killed each other\r\non slight provocation, and hoped and expected to be killed themselves\r\n--for they held it almost shame to die otherwise than "with their boots\r\non," as they expressed it.\r\n\r\nI remember an instance of a desperado\'s contempt for such small game as a\r\nprivate citizen\'s life.  I was taking a late supper in a restaurant one\r\nnight, with two reporters and a little printer named--Brown, for\r\ninstance--any name will do.  Presently a stranger with a long-tailed coat\r\non came in, and not noticing Brown\'s hat, which was lying in a chair, sat\r\ndown on it.  Little Brown sprang up and became abusive in a moment.  The\r\nstranger smiled, smoothed out the hat, and offered it to Brown with\r\nprofuse apologies couched in caustic sarcasm, and begged Brown not to\r\ndestroy him.  Brown threw off his coat and challenged the man to fight\r\n--abused him, threatened him, impeached his courage, and urged and even\r\nimplored him to fight; and in the meantime the smiling stranger placed\r\nhimself under our protection in mock distress.  But presently he assumed\r\na serious tone, and said:\r\n\r\n"Very well, gentlemen, if we must fight, we must, I suppose.  But don\'t\r\nrush into danger and then say I gave you no warning.  I am more than a\r\nmatch for all of you when I get started.  I will give you proofs, and\r\nthen if my friend here still insists, I will try to accommodate him."\r\n\r\nThe table we were sitting at was about five feet long, and unusually\r\ncumbersome and heavy.  He asked us to put our hands on the dishes and\r\nhold them in their places a moment--one of them was a large oval dish\r\nwith a portly roast on it.  Then he sat down, tilted up one end of the\r\ntable, set two of the legs on his knees, took the end of the table\r\nbetween his teeth, took his hands away, and pulled down with his teeth\r\ntill the table came up to a level position, dishes and all!  He said he\r\ncould lift a keg of nails with his teeth.  He picked up a common glass\r\ntumbler and bit a semi-circle out of it.  Then he opened his bosom and\r\nshowed us a net-work of knife and bullet scars; showed us more on his\r\narms and face, and said he believed he had bullets enough in his body to\r\nmake a pig of lead.  He was armed to the teeth.  He closed with the\r\nremark that he was Mr. ---- of Cariboo--a celebrated name whereat we shook\r\nin our shoes.  I would publish the name, but for the suspicion that he\r\nmight come and carve me.  He finally inquired if Brown still thirsted for\r\nblood.  Brown turned the thing over in his mind a moment, and then--asked\r\nhim to supper.\r\n\r\nWith the permission of the reader, I will group together, in the next\r\nchapter, some samples of life in our small mountain village in the old\r\ndays of desperadoism.  I was there at the time.  The reader will observe\r\npeculiarities in our official society; and he will observe also, an\r\ninstance of how, in new countries, murders breed murders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nAn extract or two from the newspapers of the day will furnish a\r\nphotograph that can need no embellishment:\r\n\r\n      FATAL SHOOTING AFFRAY.--An affray occurred, last evening, in a\r\n      billiard saloon on C street, between Deputy Marshal Jack Williams\r\n      and Wm. Brown, which resulted in the immediate death of the latter.\r\n      There had been some difficulty between the parties for several\r\n      months.\r\n\r\n      An inquest was immediately held, and the following testimony\r\n      adduced:\r\n\r\n      Officer GEO. BIRDSALL, sworn, says:--I was told Wm. Brown was drunk\r\n      and was looking for Jack Williams; so soon as I heard that I started\r\n      for the parties to prevent a collision; went into the billiard\r\n      saloon; saw Billy Brown running around, saying if anybody had\r\n      anything against him to show cause; he was talking in a boisterous\r\n      manner, and officer Perry took him to the other end of the room to\r\n      talk to him; Brown came back to me; remarked to me that he thought\r\n      he was as good as anybody, and knew how to take care of himself; he\r\n      passed by me and went to the bar; don\'t know whether he drank or\r\n      not; Williams was at the end of the billiard-table, next to the\r\n      stairway; Brown, after going to the bar, came back and said he was\r\n      as good as any man in the world; he had then walked out to the end\r\n      of the first billiard-table from the bar; I moved closer to them,\r\n      supposing there would be a fight; as Brown drew his pistol I caught\r\n      hold of it; he had fired one shot at Williams; don\'t know the effect\r\n      of it; caught hold of him with one hand, and took hold of the pistol\r\n      and turned it up; think he fired once after I caught hold of the\r\n      pistol; I wrenched the pistol from him; walked to the end of the\r\n      billiard-table and told a party that I had Brown\'s pistol, and to\r\n      stop shooting; I think four shots were fired in all; after walking\r\n      out, Mr. Foster remarked that Brown was shot dead.\r\n\r\nOh, there was no excitement about it--he merely "remarked" the small\r\ncircumstance!\r\n\r\nFour months later the following item appeared in the same paper (the\r\nEnterprise).  In this item the name of one of the city officers above\r\nreferred to (Deputy Marshal Jack Williams) occurs again:\r\n\r\n      ROBBERY AND DESPERATE AFFRAY.--On Tuesday night, a German named\r\n      Charles Hurtzal, engineer in a mill at Silver City, came to this\r\n      place, and visited the hurdy-gurdy house on B street.  The music,\r\n      dancing and Teutonic maidens awakened memories of Faderland until\r\n      our German friend was carried away with rapture.  He evidently had\r\n      money, and was spending if freely.  Late in the evening Jack\r\n      Williams and Andy Blessington invited him down stairs to take a cup\r\n      of coffee.  Williams proposed a game of cards and went up stairs to\r\n      procure a deck, but not finding any returned.  On the stairway he\r\n      met the German, and drawing his pistol knocked him down and rifled\r\n      his pockets of some seventy dollars.  Hurtzal dared give no alarm,\r\n      as he was told, with a pistol at his head, if he made any noise or\r\n      exposed them, they would blow his brains out.  So effectually was he\r\n      frightened that he made no complaint, until his friends forced him.\r\n      Yesterday a warrant was issued, but the culprits had disappeared.\r\n\r\nThis efficient city officer, Jack Williams, had the common reputation of\r\nbeing a burglar, a highwayman and a desperado.  It was said that he had\r\nseveral times drawn his revolver and levied money contributions on\r\ncitizens at dead of night in the public streets of Virginia.\r\n\r\nFive months after the above item appeared, Williams was assassinated\r\nwhile sitting at a card table one night; a gun was thrust through the\r\ncrack of the door and Williams dropped from his chair riddled with balls.\r\nIt was said, at the time, that Williams had been for some time aware that\r\na party of his own sort (desperadoes) had sworn away his life; and it was\r\ngenerally believed among the people that Williams\'s friends and enemies\r\nwould make the assassination memorable--and useful, too--by a wholesale\r\ndestruction of each other.\r\n\r\nIt did not so happen, but still, times were not dull during the next\r\ntwenty-four hours, for within that time a woman was killed by a pistol\r\nshot, a man was brained with a slung shot, and a man named Reeder was\r\nalso disposed of permanently.  Some matters in the Enterprise account of\r\nthe killing of Reeder are worth nothing--especially the accommodating\r\ncomplaisance of a Virginia justice of the peace.  The italics in the\r\nfollowing narrative are mine:\r\n\r\n      MORE CUTTING AND SHOOTING.--The devil seems to have again broken\r\n      loose in our town.  Pistols and guns explode and knives gleam in our\r\n      streets as in early times.  When there has been a long season of\r\n      quiet, people are slow to wet their hands in blood; but once blood\r\n      is spilled, cutting and shooting come easy.  Night before last Jack\r\n      Williams was assassinated, and yesterday forenoon we had more bloody\r\n      work, growing out of the killing of Williams, and on the same street\r\n      in which he met his death.  It appears that Tom Reeder, a friend of\r\n      Williams, and George Gumbert were talking, at the meat market of the\r\n      latter, about the killing of Williams the previous night, when\r\n      Reeder said it was a most cowardly act to shoot a man in such a way,\r\n      giving him "no show."  Gumbert said that Williams had "as good a\r\n      show as he gave Billy Brown," meaning the man killed by Williams\r\n      last March.  Reeder said it was a d---d lie, that Williams had no\r\n      show at all.  At this, Gumbert drew a knife and stabbed Reeder,\r\n      cutting him in two places in the back.  One stroke of the knife cut\r\n      into the sleeve of Reeder\'s coat and passed downward in a slanting\r\n      direction through his clothing, and entered his body at the small of\r\n      the back; another blow struck more squarely, and made a much more\r\n      dangerous wound.  Gumbert gave himself up to the officers of\r\n      justice, and was shortly after discharged by Justice Atwill, on his\r\n      own recognizance, to appear for trial at six o\'clock in the evening.\r\n      In the meantime Reeder had been taken into the office of Dr. Owens,\r\n      where his wounds were properly dressed.  One of his wounds was\r\n      considered quite dangerous, and it was thought by many that it would\r\n      prove fatal.  But being considerably under the influence of liquor,\r\n      Reeder did not feel his wounds as he otherwise would, and he got up\r\n      and went into the street.  He went to the meat market and renewed\r\n      his quarrel with Gumbert, threatening his life.  Friends tried to\r\n      interfere to put a stop to the quarrel and get the parties away from\r\n      each other.  In the Fashion Saloon Reeder made threats against the\r\n      life of Gumbert, saying he would kill him, and it is said that he\r\n      requested the officers not to arrest Gumbert, as he intended to kill\r\n      him.  After these threats Gumbert went off and procured a\r\n      double-barreled shot gun, loaded with buck-shot or revolver balls,\r\n      and went after Reeder.  Two or three persons were assisting him along\r\n      the street, trying to get him home, and had him just in front of the\r\n      store of Klopstock & Harris, when Gumbert came across toward him\r\n      from the opposite side of the street with his gun.  He came up\r\n      within about ten or fifteen feet of Reeder, and called out to those\r\n      with him to "look out! get out of the way!" and they had only time\r\n      to heed the warning, when he fired.  Reeder was at the time\r\n      attempting to screen himself behind a large cask, which stood\r\n      against the awning post of Klopstock & Harris\'s store, but some of\r\n      the balls took effect in the lower part of his breast, and he reeled\r\n      around forward and fell in front of the cask.  Gumbert then raised\r\n      his gun and fired the second barrel, which missed Reeder and entered\r\n      the ground.  At the time that this occurred, there were a great many\r\n      persons on the street in the vicinity, and a number of them called\r\n      out to Gumbert, when they saw him raise his gun, to "hold on," and\r\n      "don\'t shoot!"  The cutting took place about ten o\'clock and the\r\n      shooting about twelve.  After the shooting the street was instantly\r\n      crowded with the inhabitants of that part of the town, some\r\n      appearing much excited and laughing--declaring that it looked like\r\n      the "good old times of \'60."  Marshal Perry and officer Birdsall\r\n      were near when the shooting occurred, and Gumbert was immediately\r\n      arrested and his gun taken from him, when he was marched off to\r\n      jail.  Many persons who were attracted to the spot where this bloody\r\n      work had just taken place, looked bewildered and seemed to be asking\r\n      themselves what was to happen next, appearing in doubt as to whether\r\n      the killing mania had reached its climax, or whether we were to turn\r\n      in and have a grand killing spell, shooting whoever might have given\r\n      us offence.  It was whispered around that it was not all over yet\r\n      --five or six more were to be killed before night.  Reeder was taken\r\n      to the Virginia City Hotel, and doctors called in to examine his\r\n      wounds.  They found that two or three balls had entered his right\r\n      side; one of them appeared to have passed through the substance of\r\n      the lungs, while another passed into the liver.  Two balls were also\r\n      found to have struck one of his legs.  As some of the balls struck\r\n      the cask, the wounds in Reeder\'s leg were probably from these,\r\n      glancing downwards, though they might have been caused by the second\r\n      shot fired.  After being shot, Reeder said when he got on his feet\r\n      --smiling as he spoke--"It will take better shooting than that to\r\n      kill me."  The doctors consider it almost impossible for him to\r\n      recover, but as he has an excellent constitution he may survive,\r\n      notwithstanding the number and dangerous character of the wounds he\r\n      has received.  The town appears to be perfectly quiet at present, as\r\n      though the late stormy times had cleared our moral atmosphere; but\r\n      who can tell in what quarter clouds are lowering or plots ripening?\r\n\r\nReeder--or at least what was left of him--survived his wounds two days!\r\nNothing was ever done with Gumbert.\r\n\r\nTrial by jury is the palladium of our liberties.  I do not know what a\r\npalladium is, having never seen a palladium, but it is a good thing no\r\ndoubt at any rate.  Not less than a hundred men have been murdered in\r\nNevada--perhaps I would be within bounds if I said three hundred--and as\r\nfar as I can learn, only two persons have suffered the death penalty\r\nthere.  However, four or five who had no money and no political influence\r\nhave been punished by imprisonment--one languished in prison as much as\r\neight months, I think.  However, I do not desire to be extravagant--it\r\nmay have been less.\r\n\r\nHowever, one prophecy was verified, at any rate.  It was asserted by the\r\ndesperadoes that one of their brethren (Joe McGee, a special policeman)\r\nwas known to be the conspirator chosen by lot to assassinate Williams;\r\nand they also asserted that doom had been pronounced against McGee, and\r\nthat he would be assassinated in exactly the same manner that had been\r\nadopted for the destruction of Williams--a prophecy which came true a\r\nyear later.  After twelve months of distress (for McGee saw a fancied\r\nassassin in every man that approached him), he made the last of many\r\nefforts to get out of the country unwatched.  He went to Carson and sat\r\ndown in a saloon to wait for the stage--it would leave at four in the\r\nmorning.  But as the night waned and the crowd thinned, he grew uneasy,\r\nand told the bar-keeper that assassins were on his track.  The bar-keeper\r\ntold him to stay in the middle of the room, then, and not go near the\r\ndoor, or the window by the stove.  But a fatal fascination seduced him to\r\nthe neighborhood of the stove every now and then, and repeatedly the\r\nbar-keeper brought him back to the middle of the room and warned him to\r\nremain there.  But he could not.  At three in the morning he again\r\nreturned to the stove and sat down by a stranger.  Before the bar-keeper\r\ncould get to him with another warning whisper, some one outside fired\r\nthrough the window and riddled McGee\'s breast with slugs, killing him\r\nalmost instantly.  By the same discharge the stranger at McGee\'s side\r\nalso received attentions which proved fatal in the course of two or three\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nThese murder and jury statistics remind me of a certain very\r\nextraordinary trial and execution of twenty years ago; it is a scrap of\r\nhistory familiar to all old Californians, and worthy to be known by other\r\npeoples of the earth that love simple, straightforward justice\r\nunencumbered with nonsense.  I would apologize for this digression but\r\nfor the fact that the information I am about to offer is apology enough\r\nin itself.  And since I digress constantly anyhow, perhaps it is as well\r\nto eschew apologies altogether and thus prevent their growing irksome.\r\n\r\nCapt. Ned Blakely--that name will answer as well as any other fictitious\r\none (for he was still with the living at last accounts, and may not\r\ndesire to be famous)--sailed ships out of the harbor of San Francisco for\r\nmany years.  He was a stalwart, warm-hearted, eagle-eyed veteran, who had\r\nbeen a sailor nearly fifty years--a sailor from early boyhood.  He was a\r\nrough, honest creature, full of pluck, and just as full of hard-headed\r\nsimplicity, too.  He hated trifling conventionalities--"business" was the\r\nword, with him.  He had all a sailor\'s vindictiveness against the quips\r\nand quirks of the law, and steadfastly believed that the first and last\r\naim and object of the law and lawyers was to defeat justice.\r\n\r\nHe sailed for the Chincha Islands in command of a guano ship.  He had a\r\nfine crew, but his negro mate was his pet--on him he had for years\r\nlavished his admiration and esteem.  It was Capt. Ned\'s first voyage to\r\nthe Chinchas, but his fame had gone before him--the fame of being a man\r\nwho would fight at the dropping of a handkerchief, when imposed upon, and\r\nwould stand no nonsense.  It was a fame well earned.  Arrived in the\r\nislands, he found that the staple of conversation was the exploits of one\r\nBill Noakes, a bully, the mate of a trading ship.  This man had created a\r\nsmall reign of terror there.  At nine o\'clock at night, Capt. Ned, all\r\nalone, was pacing his deck in the starlight.  A form ascended the side,\r\nand approached him.  Capt. Ned said:\r\n\r\n"Who goes there?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m Bill Noakes, the best man in the islands."\r\n\r\n"What do you want aboard this ship?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve heard of Capt. Ned Blakely, and one of us is a better man than\r\n\'tother--I\'ll know which, before I go ashore."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve come to the right shop--I\'m your man.  I\'ll learn you to come\r\naboard this ship without an invite."\r\n\r\nHe seized Noakes, backed him against the mainmast, pounded his face to a\r\npulp, and then threw him overboard.\r\n\r\nNoakes was not convinced.  He returned the next night, got the pulp\r\nrenewed, and went overboard head first, as before.\r\n\r\nHe was satisfied.\r\n\r\nA week after this, while Noakes was carousing with a sailor crowd on\r\nshore, at noonday, Capt. Ned\'s colored mate came along, and Noakes tried\r\nto pick a quarrel with him.  The negro evaded the trap, and tried to get\r\naway.  Noakes followed him up; the negro began to run; Noakes fired on\r\nhim with a revolver and killed him.  Half a dozen sea-captains witnessed\r\nthe whole affair.  Noakes retreated to the small after-cabin of his ship,\r\nwith two other bullies, and gave out that death would be the portion of\r\nany man that intruded there.  There was no attempt made to follow the\r\nvillains; there was no disposition to do it, and indeed very little\r\nthought of such an enterprise.  There were no courts and no officers;\r\nthere was no government; the islands belonged to Peru, and Peru was far\r\naway; she had no official representative on the ground; and neither had\r\nany other nation.\r\n\r\nHowever, Capt. Ned was not perplexing his head about such things.  They\r\nconcerned him not.  He was boiling with rage and furious for justice.\r\nAt nine o\'clock at night he loaded a double-barreled gun with slugs,\r\nfished out a pair of handcuffs, got a ship\'s lantern, summoned his\r\nquartermaster, and went ashore.  He said:\r\n\r\n"Do you see that ship there at the dock?"\r\n\r\n"Ay-ay, sir."\r\n\r\n"It\'s the Venus."\r\n\r\n"Ay-ay, sir."\r\n\r\n"You--you know me."\r\n\r\n"Ay-ay, sir."\r\n\r\n"Very well, then.  Take the lantern.  Carry it just under your chin.\r\nI\'ll walk behind you and rest this gun-barrel on your shoulder, p\'inting\r\nforward--so.  Keep your lantern well up so\'s I can see things ahead of\r\nyou good.  I\'m going to march in on Noakes--and take him--and jug the\r\nother chaps.  If you flinch--well, you know me."\r\n\r\n"Ay-ay, sir."\r\n\r\nIn this order they filed aboard softly, arrived at Noakes\'s den, the\r\nquartermaster pushed the door open, and the lantern revealed the three\r\ndesperadoes sitting on the floor.  Capt.  Ned said:\r\n\r\n"I\'m Ned Blakely.  I\'ve got you under fire.  Don\'t you move without\r\norders--any of you.  You two kneel down in the corner; faces to the wall\r\n--now.  Bill Noakes, put these handcuffs on; now come up close.\r\nQuartermaster, fasten \'em.  All right.  Don\'t stir, sir.  Quartermaster,\r\nput the key in the outside of the door.  Now, men, I\'m going to lock you\r\ntwo in; and if you try to burst through this door--well, you\'ve heard of\r\nme.  Bill Noakes, fall in ahead, and march.  All set.  Quartermaster,\r\nlock the door."\r\n\r\nNoakes spent the night on board Blakely\'s ship, a prisoner under strict\r\nguard.  Early in the morning Capt. Ned called in all the sea-captains in\r\nthe harbor and invited them, with nautical ceremony, to be present on\r\nboard his ship at nine o\'clock to witness the hanging of Noakes at the\r\nyard-arm!\r\n\r\n"What!  The man has not been tried."\r\n\r\n"Of course he hasn\'t.  But didn\'t he kill the nigger?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly he did; but you are not thinking of hanging him without a\r\ntrial?"\r\n\r\n"Trial!  What do I want to try him for, if he killed the nigger?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Capt.  Ned, this will never do.  Think how it will sound."\r\n\r\n"Sound be hanged!  Didn\'t he kill the nigger?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, certainly, Capt.  Ned,--nobody denies that,--but--"\r\n\r\n"Then I\'m going to hang him, that\'s all.  Everybody I\'ve talked to talks\r\njust the same way you do.  Everybody says he killed the nigger, everybody\r\nknows he killed the nigger, and yet every lubber of you wants him tried\r\nfor it.  I don\'t understand such bloody foolishness as that.  Tried!\r\nMind you, I don\'t object to trying him, if it\'s got to be done to give\r\nsatisfaction; and I\'ll be there, and chip in and help, too; but put it\r\noff till afternoon--put it off till afternoon, for I\'ll have my hands\r\nmiddling full till after the burying--"\r\n\r\n"Why, what do you mean?  Are you going to hang him any how--and try him\r\nafterward?"\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I say I was going to hang him?  I never saw such people as you.\r\nWhat\'s the difference?  You ask a favor, and then you ain\'t satisfied\r\nwhen you get it.  Before or after\'s all one--you know how the trial will\r\ngo.  He killed the nigger.  Say--I must be going.  If your mate would\r\nlike to come to the hanging, fetch him along.  I like him."\r\n\r\nThere was a stir in the camp.  The captains came in a body and pleaded\r\nwith Capt. Ned not to do this rash thing.  They promised that they would\r\ncreate a court composed of captains of the best character; they would\r\nempanel a jury; they would conduct everything in a way becoming the\r\nserious nature of the business in hand, and give the case an impartial\r\nhearing and the accused a fair trial.  And they said it would be murder,\r\nand punishable by the American courts if he persisted and hung the\r\naccused on his ship.  They pleaded hard.  Capt. Ned said:\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, I\'m not stubborn and I\'m not unreasonable.  I\'m always\r\nwilling to do just as near right as I can.  How long will it take?"\r\n\r\n"Probably only a little while."\r\n\r\n"And can I take him up the shore and hang him as soon as you are done?"\r\n\r\n"If he is proven guilty he shall be hanged without unnecessary delay."\r\n\r\n"If he\'s proven guilty.  Great Neptune, ain\'t he guilty?  This beats my\r\ntime.  Why you all know he\'s guilty."\r\n\r\nBut at last they satisfied him that they were projecting nothing\r\nunderhanded.  Then he said:\r\n\r\n"Well, all right.  You go on and try him and I\'ll go down and overhaul\r\nhis conscience and prepare him to go--like enough he needs it, and I\r\ndon\'t want to send him off without a show for hereafter."\r\n\r\nThis was another obstacle.  They finally convinced him that it was\r\nnecessary to have the accused in court.  Then they said they would send a\r\nguard to bring him.\r\n\r\n"No, sir, I prefer to fetch him myself--he don\'t get out of my hands.\r\nBesides, I\'ve got to go to the ship to get a rope, anyway."\r\n\r\nThe court assembled with due ceremony, empaneled a jury, and presently\r\nCapt. Ned entered, leading the prisoner with one hand and carrying a\r\nBible and a rope in the other.  He seated himself by the side of his\r\ncaptive and told the court to "up anchor and make sail."  Then he turned\r\na searching eye on the jury, and detected Noakes\'s friends, the two\r\nbullies.\r\n\r\nHe strode over and said to them confidentially:\r\n\r\n"You\'re here to interfere, you see.  Now you vote right, do you hear?--or\r\nelse there\'ll be a double-barreled inquest here when this trial\'s off,\r\nand your remainders will go home in a couple of baskets."\r\n\r\nThe caution was not without fruit.  The jury was a unit--the verdict.\r\n"Guilty."\r\n\r\nCapt.  Ned sprung to his feet and said:\r\n\r\n"Come along--you\'re my meat now, my lad, anyway.  Gentlemen you\'ve done\r\nyourselves proud.  I invite you all to come and see that I do it all\r\nstraight.  Follow me to the canyon, a mile above here."\r\n\r\nThe court informed him that a sheriff had been appointed to do the\r\nhanging, and--\r\n\r\nCapt.  Ned\'s patience was at an end.  His wrath was boundless.  The\r\nsubject of a sheriff was judiciously dropped.\r\n\r\nWhen the crowd arrived at the canyon, Capt. Ned climbed a tree and\r\narranged the halter, then came down and noosed his man.  He opened his\r\nBible, and laid aside his hat.  Selecting a chapter at random, he read it\r\nthrough, in a deep bass voice and with sincere solemnity.  Then he said:\r\n\r\n"Lad, you are about to go aloft and give an account of yourself; and the\r\nlighter a man\'s manifest is, as far as sin\'s concerned, the better for\r\nhim.  Make a clean breast, man, and carry a log with you that\'ll bear\r\ninspection.  You killed the nigger?"\r\n\r\nNo reply.  A long pause.\r\n\r\nThe captain read another chapter, pausing, from time to time, to impress\r\nthe effect.  Then he talked an earnest, persuasive sermon to him, and\r\nended by repeating the question:\r\n\r\n"Did you kill the nigger?"\r\n\r\nNo reply--other than a malignant scowl.  The captain now read the first\r\nand second chapters of Genesis, with deep feeling--paused a moment,\r\nclosed the book reverently, and said with a perceptible savor of\r\nsatisfaction:\r\n\r\n"There.  Four chapters.  There\'s few that would have took the pains with\r\nyou that I have."\r\n\r\nThen he swung up the condemned, and made the rope fast; stood by and\r\ntimed him half an hour with his watch, and then delivered the body to the\r\ncourt.  A little after, as he stood contemplating the motionless figure,\r\na doubt came into his face; evidently he felt a twinge of conscience--a\r\nmisgiving--and he said with a sigh:\r\n\r\n"Well, p\'raps I ought to burnt him, maybe.  But I was trying to do for\r\nthe best."\r\n\r\nWhen the history of this affair reached California (it was in the "early\r\ndays") it made a deal of talk, but did not diminish the captain\'s\r\npopularity in any degree.  It increased it, indeed.  California had a\r\npopulation then that "inflicted" justice after a fashion that was\r\nsimplicity and primitiveness itself, and could therefore admire\r\nappreciatively when the same fashion was followed elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nVice flourished luxuriantly during the hey-day of our "flush times."  The\r\nsaloons were overburdened with custom; so were the police courts, the\r\ngambling dens, the brothels and the jails--unfailing signs of high\r\nprosperity in a mining region--in any region for that matter.  Is it not\r\nso?  A crowded police court docket is the surest of all signs that trade\r\nis brisk and money plenty.  Still, there is one other sign; it comes\r\nlast, but when it does come it establishes beyond cavil that the "flush\r\ntimes" are at the flood.  This is the birth of the "literary" paper.\r\nThe Weekly Occidental, "devoted to literature," made its appearance in\r\nVirginia.  All the literary people were engaged to write for it.  Mr. F.\r\nwas to edit it.  He was a felicitous skirmisher with a pen, and a man who\r\ncould say happy things in a crisp, neat way.  Once, while editor of the\r\nUnion, he had disposed of a labored, incoherent, two-column attack made\r\nupon him by a contemporary, with a single line, which, at first glance,\r\nseemed to contain a solemn and tremendous compliment--viz.: "THE LOGIC OF\r\nOUR ADVERSARY RESEMBLES THE PEACE OF GOD,"--and left it to the reader\'s\r\nmemory and after-thought to invest the remark with another and "more\r\ndifferent" meaning by supplying for himself and at his own leisure the\r\nrest of the Scripture--"in that it passeth understanding."  He once said\r\nof a little, half-starved, wayside community that had no subsistence\r\nexcept what they could get by preying upon chance passengers who stopped\r\nover with them a day when traveling by the overland stage, that in their\r\nChurch service they had altered the Lord\'s Prayer to read: "Give us this\r\nday our daily stranger!"\r\n\r\nWe expected great things of the Occidental.  Of course it could not get\r\nalong without an original novel, and so we made arrangements to hurl into\r\nthe work the full strength of the company.  Mrs. F. was an able romancist\r\nof the ineffable school--I know no other name to apply to a school whose\r\nheroes are all dainty and all perfect.  She wrote the opening chapter,\r\nand introduced a lovely blonde simpleton who talked nothing but pearls\r\nand poetry and who was virtuous to the verge of eccentricity.  She also\r\nintroduced a young French Duke of aggravated refinement, in love with the\r\nblonde.  Mr. F. followed next week, with a brilliant lawyer who set about\r\ngetting the Duke\'s estates into trouble, and a sparkling young lady of\r\nhigh society who fell to fascinating the Duke and impairing the appetite\r\nof the blonde.  Mr. D., a dark and bloody editor of one of the dailies,\r\nfollowed Mr. F., the third  week, introducing a mysterious Roscicrucian\r\nwho transmuted metals, held consultations with the devil in a cave at\r\ndead of night, and cast the horoscope of the several heroes and heroines\r\nin such a way as to provide plenty of trouble for their future careers\r\nand breed a solemn and awful public interest in the novel.  He also\r\nintroduced a cloaked and masked melodramatic miscreant, put him on a\r\nsalary and set him on the midnight track of the Duke with a poisoned\r\ndagger.  He also created an Irish coachman with a rich brogue and placed\r\nhim in the service of the society-young-lady with an ulterior mission to\r\ncarry billet-doux to the Duke.\r\n\r\nAbout this time there arrived in Virginia a dissolute stranger with a\r\nliterary turn of mind--rather seedy he was, but very quiet and\r\nunassuming; almost diffident, indeed.  He was so gentle, and his manners\r\nwere so pleasing and kindly, whether he was sober or intoxicated, that he\r\nmade friends of all who came in contact with him.  He applied for\r\nliterary work, offered conclusive evidence that he wielded an easy and\r\npracticed pen, and so Mr. F. engaged him at once to help write the novel.\r\nHis chapter was to follow Mr. D.\'s, and mine was to come next.  Now what\r\ndoes this fellow do but go off and get drunk and then proceed to his\r\nquarters and set to work with his imagination in a state of chaos, and\r\nthat chaos in a condition of extravagant activity.  The result may be\r\nguessed.  He scanned the chapters of his predecessors, found plenty of\r\nheroes and heroines already created, and was satisfied with them; he\r\ndecided to introduce no more; with all the confidence that whisky\r\ninspires and all the easy complacency it gives to its servant, he then\r\nlaunched himself lovingly into his work: he married the coachman to the\r\nsociety-young-lady for the sake of the scandal; married the Duke to the\r\nblonde\'s stepmother, for the sake of the sensation; stopped the\r\ndesperado\'s salary; created a misunderstanding between the devil and the\r\nRoscicrucian; threw the Duke\'s property into the wicked lawyer\'s hands;\r\nmade the lawyer\'s upbraiding conscience drive him to drink, thence to\r\ndelirium tremens, thence to suicide; broke the coachman\'s neck; let his\r\nwidow succumb to contumely, neglect, poverty and consumption; caused the\r\nblonde to drown herself, leaving her clothes on the bank with the\r\ncustomary note pinned to them forgiving the Duke and hoping he would be\r\nhappy; revealed to the Duke, by means of the usual strawberry mark on\r\nleft arm, that he had married his own long-lost mother and destroyed his\r\nlong-lost sister; instituted the proper and necessary suicide of the Duke\r\nand the Duchess in order to compass poetical justice; opened the earth\r\nand let the Roscicrucian through, accompanied with the accustomed smoke\r\nand thunder and smell of brimstone, and finished with the promise that in\r\nthe next chapter, after holding a general inquest, he would take up the\r\nsurviving character of the novel and tell what became of the devil!\r\nIt read with singular smoothness, and with a "dead" earnestness that was\r\nfunny enough to suffocate a body.  But there was war when it came in.\r\nThe other novelists were furious.  The mild stranger, not yet more than\r\nhalf sober, stood there, under a scathing fire of vituperation, meek and\r\nbewildered, looking from one to another of his assailants, and wondering\r\nwhat he could have done to invoke such a storm.  When a lull came at\r\nlast, he said his say gently and appealingly--said he did not rightly\r\nremember what he had written, but was sure he had tried to do the best he\r\ncould, and knew his object had been to make the novel not only pleasant\r\nand plausible but instructive and----\r\n\r\nThe bombardment began again.  The novelists assailed his ill-chosen\r\nadjectives and demolished them with a storm of denunciation and ridicule.\r\nAnd so the siege went on.  Every time the stranger tried to appease the\r\nenemy he only made matters worse.  Finally he offered to rewrite the\r\nchapter.  This arrested hostilities.  The indignation gradually quieted\r\ndown, peace reigned again and the sufferer retired in safety and got him\r\nto his own citadel.\r\n\r\nBut on the way thither the evil angel tempted him and he got drunk again.\r\nAnd again his imagination went mad.  He led the heroes and heroines a\r\nwilder dance than ever; and yet all through it ran that same convincing\r\nair of honesty and earnestness that had marked his first work.  He got\r\nthe characters into the most extraordinary situations, put them through\r\nthe most surprising performances, and made them talk the strangest talk!\r\nBut the chapter cannot be described.  It was symmetrically crazy; it was\r\nartistically absurd; and it had explanatory footnotes that were fully as\r\ncurious as the text.  I remember one of the "situations," and will offer\r\nit as an example of the whole.  He altered the character of the brilliant\r\nlawyer, and made him a great-hearted, splendid fellow; gave him fame and\r\nriches, and set his age at thirty-three years.  Then he made the blonde\r\ndiscover, through the help of the Roscicrucian and the melodramatic\r\nmiscreant, that while the Duke loved her money ardently and wanted it, he\r\nsecretly felt a sort of leaning toward the society-young-lady.  Stung to\r\nthe quick, she tore her affections from him and bestowed them with\r\ntenfold power upon the lawyer, who responded with consuming zeal.  But\r\nthe parents would none of it.  What they wanted in the family was a Duke;\r\nand a Duke they were determined to have; though they confessed that next\r\nto the Duke the lawyer had their preference.  Necessarily the blonde now\r\nwent into a decline.  The parents were alarmed.  They pleaded with her to\r\nmarry the Duke, but she steadfastly refused, and pined on.  Then they\r\nlaid a plan.  They told her to wait a year and a day, and if at the end\r\nof that time she still felt that she could not marry the Duke, she might\r\nmarry the lawyer with their full consent.  The result was as they had\r\nforeseen: gladness came again, and the flush of returning health.  Then\r\nthe parents took the next step in their scheme.  They had the family\r\nphysician recommend a long sea voyage and much land travel for the\r\nthorough restoration of the blonde\'s strength; and they invited the Duke\r\nto be of the party.  They judged that the Duke\'s constant presence and\r\nthe lawyer\'s protracted absence would do the rest--for they did not\r\ninvite the lawyer.\r\n\r\nSo they set sail in a steamer for America--and the third day out, when\r\ntheir sea-sickness called truce and permitted them to take their first\r\nmeal at the public table, behold there sat the lawyer!  The Duke and\r\nparty made the best of an awkward situation; the voyage progressed, and\r\nthe vessel neared America.\r\n\r\nBut, by and by, two hundred miles off New Bedford, the ship took fire;\r\nshe burned to the water\'s edge; of all her crew and passengers, only\r\nthirty were saved.  They floated about the sea half an afternoon and all\r\nnight long.  Among them were our friends.  The lawyer, by superhuman\r\nexertions, had saved the blonde and her parents, swimming back and forth\r\ntwo hundred yards and bringing one each time--(the girl first).  The Duke\r\nhad saved himself.  In the morning two whale ships arrived on the scene\r\nand sent their boats.  The weather was stormy and the embarkation was\r\nattended with much confusion and excitement.  The lawyer did his duty\r\nlike a man; helped his exhausted and insensible blonde, her parents and\r\nsome others into a boat (the Duke helped himself in); then a child fell\r\noverboard at the other end of the raft and the lawyer rushed thither and\r\nhelped half a dozen people fish it out, under the stimulus of its\r\nmother\'s screams.  Then he ran back--a few seconds too late--the blonde\'s\r\nboat was under way.  So he had to take the other boat, and go to the\r\nother ship.  The storm increased and drove the vessels out of sight of\r\neach other--drove them whither it would.\r\n\r\nWhen it calmed, at the end of three days, the blonde\'s ship was seven\r\nhundred miles north of Boston and the other about seven hundred south of\r\nthat port.  The blonde\'s captain was bound on a whaling cruise in the\r\nNorth Atlantic and could not go back such a distance or make a port\r\nwithout orders; such being nautical law.  The lawyer\'s captain was to\r\ncruise in the North Pacific, and he could not go back or make a port\r\nwithout orders.  All the lawyer\'s money and baggage were in the blonde\'s\r\nboat and went to the blonde\'s ship--so his captain made him work his\r\npassage as a common sailor.  When both ships had been cruising nearly a\r\nyear, the one was off the coast of Greenland and the other in Behring\'s\r\nStrait.  The blonde had long ago been well-nigh persuaded that her lawyer\r\nhad been washed overboard and lost just before the whale ships reached\r\nthe raft, and now, under the pleadings of her parents and the Duke she\r\nwas at last beginning to nerve herself for the doom of the covenant, and\r\nprepare for the hated marriage.\r\n\r\nBut she would not yield a day before the date set.  The weeks dragged on,\r\nthe time narrowed, orders were given to deck the ship for the wedding--a\r\nwedding at sea among icebergs and walruses.  Five days more and all would\r\nbe over.  So the blonde reflected, with a sigh and a tear.  Oh where was\r\nher true love--and why, why did he not come and save her?  At that moment\r\nhe was lifting his harpoon to strike a whale in Behring\'s Strait, five\r\nthousand miles away, by the way of the Arctic Ocean, or twenty thousand\r\nby the way of the Horn--that was the reason.  He struck, but not with\r\nperfect aim--his foot slipped and he fell in the whale\'s mouth and went\r\ndown his throat.  He was insensible five days.  Then he came to himself\r\nand heard voices; daylight was streaming through a hole cut in the\r\nwhale\'s roof.  He climbed out and astonished the sailors who were\r\nhoisting blubber up a ship\'s side.  He recognized the vessel, flew\r\naboard, surprised the wedding party at the altar and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Stop the proceedings--I\'m here!  Come to my arms, my own!"\r\n\r\nThere were foot-notes to this extravagant piece of literature wherein the\r\nauthor endeavored to show that the whole thing was within the\r\npossibilities; he said he got the incident of the whale traveling from\r\nBehring\'s Strait to the coast of Greenland, five thousand miles in five\r\ndays, through the Arctic Ocean, from Charles Reade\'s "Love Me Little Love\r\nMe Long," and considered that that established the fact that the thing\r\ncould be done; and he instanced Jonah\'s adventure as proof that a man\r\ncould live in a whale\'s belly, and added that if a preacher could stand\r\nit three days a lawyer could surely stand it five!\r\n\r\nThere was a fiercer storm than ever in the editorial sanctum now, and the\r\nstranger was peremptorily discharged, and his manuscript flung at his\r\nhead.  But he had already delayed things so much that there was not time\r\nfor some one else to rewrite the chapter, and so the paper came out\r\nwithout any novel in it.  It was but a feeble, struggling, stupid\r\njournal, and the absence of the novel probably shook public confidence;\r\nat any rate, before the first side of the next issue went to press, the\r\nWeekly Occidental died as peacefully as an infant.\r\n\r\nAn effort was made to resurrect it, with the proposed advantage of a\r\ntelling new title, and Mr. F. said that The Phenix would be just the name\r\nfor it, because it would give the idea of a resurrection from its dead\r\nashes in a new and undreamed of condition of splendor; but some\r\nlow-priced smarty on one of the dailies suggested that we call it the\r\nLazarus; and inasmuch as the people were not profound in Scriptural\r\nmatters but thought the resurrected Lazarus and the dilapidated mendicant\r\nthat begged in the rich man\'s gateway were one and the same person, the\r\nname became the laughing stock of the town, and killed the paper for good\r\nand all.\r\n\r\nI was sorry enough, for I was very proud of being connected with a\r\nliterary paper--prouder than I have ever been of anything since, perhaps.\r\nI had written some rhymes for it--poetry I considered it--and it was a\r\ngreat grief to me that the production was on the "first side" of the\r\nissue that was not completed, and hence did not see the light.  But time\r\nbrings its revenges--I can put it in here; it will answer in place of a\r\ntear dropped to the memory of the lost Occidental.  The idea (not the\r\nchief idea, but the vehicle that bears it) was probably suggested by the\r\nold song called "The Raging Canal," but I cannot remember now.  I do\r\nremember, though, that at that time I thought my doggerel was one of the\r\nablest poems of the age:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AGED PILOT MAN.\r\n\r\nOn the Erie Canal, it was,\r\nAll on a summer\'s day,\r\nI sailed forth with my parents\r\nFar away to Albany.\r\n\r\nFrom out the clouds at noon that day\r\nThere came a dreadful storm,\r\nThat piled the billows high about,\r\nAnd filled us with alarm.\r\n\r\nA man came rushing from a house,\r\nSaying, "Snub up your boat I pray,\r\n[The customary canal technicality for \'tie up.\']\r\nSnub up your boat, snub up, alas,\r\nSnub up while yet you may."\r\n\r\nOur captain cast one glance astern,\r\nThen forward glanced he,\r\nAnd said, "My wife and little ones\r\nI never more shall see."\r\n\r\nSaid Dollinger the pilot man,\r\nIn noble words, but few,\r\n--"Fear not, but lean on Dollinger,\r\nAnd he will fetch you through."\r\n\r\nThe boat drove on, the frightened mules\r\nTore through the rain and wind,\r\nAnd bravely still, in danger\'s post,\r\nThe whip-boy strode behind.\r\n\r\n"Come \'board, come \'board," the captain cried,\r\n"Nor tempt so wild a storm;"\r\nBut still the raging mules advanced,\r\nAnd still the boy strode on.\r\n\r\nThen said the captain to us all,\r\n"Alas, \'tis plain to me,\r\nThe greater danger is not there,\r\nBut here upon the sea.\r\n\r\n"So let us strive, while life remains,\r\nTo save all souls on board,\r\nAnd then if die at last we must,\r\nLet .  .  .  .  I cannot speak the word!"\r\n\r\nSaid Dollinger the pilot man,\r\nTow\'ring above the crew,\r\n"Fear not, but trust in Dollinger,\r\nAnd he will fetch you through."\r\n\r\n"Low bridge!  low bridge!" all heads went down,\r\nThe laboring bark sped on;\r\nA mill we passed, we passed church,\r\nHamlets, and fields of corn;\r\nAnd all the world came out to see,\r\nAnd chased along the shore\r\nCrying, "Alas, alas, the sheeted rain,\r\nThe wind, the tempest\'s roar!\r\nAlas, the gallant ship and crew,\r\nCan nothing help them more?"\r\n\r\nAnd from our deck sad eyes looked out\r\nAcross the stormy scene:\r\nThe tossing wake of billows aft,\r\nThe bending forests green,\r\nThe chickens sheltered under carts\r\nIn lee of barn the cows,\r\nThe skurrying swine with straw in mouth,\r\nThe wild spray from our bows!\r\n\r\n"She balances!\r\nShe wavers!\r\nNow let her go about!\r\nIf she misses stays and broaches to,\r\nWe\'re all"--then with a shout,\r\n"Huray!  huray!\r\nAvast!  belay!\r\nTake in more sail!\r\nLord, what a gale!\r\nHo, boy, haul taut on the hind mule\'s tail!"\r\n"Ho! lighten ship! ho! man the pump!\r\nHo, hostler, heave the lead!"\r\n\r\n"A quarter-three!--\'tis shoaling fast!\r\nThree feet large!--t-h-r-e-e feet!\r\n--Three feet scant!" I cried in fright\r\n"Oh, is there no retreat?"\r\n\r\nSaid Dollinger, the pilot man,\r\nAs on the vessel flew,\r\n"Fear not, but trust in Dollinger,\r\nAnd he will fetch you through."\r\n\r\nA panic struck the bravest hearts,\r\nThe boldest cheek turned pale;\r\nFor plain to all, this shoaling said\r\nA leak had burst the ditch\'s bed!\r\nAnd, straight as bolt from crossbow sped,\r\nOur ship swept on, with shoaling lead,\r\nBefore the fearful gale!\r\n\r\n"Sever the tow-line!  Cripple the mules!"\r\nToo late!  There comes a shock!\r\nAnother length, and the fated craft\r\nWould have swum in the saving lock!\r\n\r\nThen gathered together the shipwrecked crew\r\nAnd took one last embrace,\r\nWhile sorrowful tears from despairing eyes\r\nRan down each hopeless face;\r\nAnd some did think of their little ones\r\nWhom they never more might see,\r\nAnd others of waiting wives at home,\r\nAnd mothers that grieved would be.\r\n\r\nBut of all the children of misery there\r\nOn that poor sinking frame,\r\nBut one spake words of hope and faith,\r\nAnd I worshipped as they came:\r\nSaid Dollinger the pilot man,\r\n--(O brave heart, strong and true!)\r\n--"Fear not, but trust in Dollinger,\r\nFor he will fetch you through."\r\n\r\nLo!  scarce the words have passed his lips\r\nThe dauntless prophet say\'th,\r\nWhen every soul about him seeth\r\nA wonder crown his faith!\r\n\r\n"And count ye all, both great and small,\r\nAs numbered with the dead:\r\nFor mariner for forty year,\r\nOn Erie, boy and man,\r\nI never yet saw such a storm,\r\nOr one\'t with it began!"\r\n\r\nSo overboard a keg of nails\r\nAnd anvils three we threw,\r\nLikewise four bales of gunny-sacks,\r\nTwo hundred pounds of glue,\r\nTwo sacks of corn, four ditto wheat,\r\nA box of books, a cow,\r\nA violin, Lord Byron\'s works,\r\nA rip-saw and a sow.\r\n\r\nA curve!  a curve!  the dangers grow!\r\n"Labbord!--stabbord!--s-t-e-a-d-y!--so!\r\n--Hard-a-port, Dol!--hellum-a-lee!\r\nHaw the head mule!--the aft one gee!\r\nLuff!--bring her to the wind!"\r\n\r\nFor straight a farmer brought a plank,\r\n--(Mysteriously inspired)\r\n--And laying it unto the ship,\r\nIn silent awe retired.\r\n\r\nThen every sufferer stood amazed\r\nThat pilot man before;\r\nA moment stood.  Then wondering turned,\r\nAnd speechless walked ashore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nSince I desire, in this chapter, to say an instructive word or two about\r\nthe silver mines, the reader may take this fair warning and skip, if he\r\nchooses.  The year 1863 was perhaps the very top blossom and culmination\r\nof the "flush times."  Virginia swarmed with men and vehicles to that\r\ndegree that the place looked like a very hive--that is when one\'s vision\r\ncould pierce through the thick fog of alkali dust that was generally\r\nblowing in summer.  I will say, concerning this dust, that if you drove\r\nten miles through it, you and your horses would be coated with it a\r\nsixteenth of an inch thick and present an outside appearance that was a\r\nuniform pale yellow color, and your buggy would have three inches of dust\r\nin it, thrown there by the wheels.  The delicate scales used by the\r\nassayers were inclosed in glass cases intended to be air-tight, and yet\r\nsome of this dust was so impalpable and so invisibly fine that it would\r\nget in, somehow, and impair the accuracy of those scales.\r\n\r\nSpeculation ran riot, and yet there was a world of substantial business\r\ngoing on, too.  All freights were brought over the mountains from\r\nCalifornia (150 miles) by pack-train partly, and partly in huge wagons\r\ndrawn by such long mule teams that each team amounted to a procession,\r\nand it did seem, sometimes, that the grand combined procession of animals\r\nstretched unbroken from Virginia to California.  Its long route was\r\ntraceable clear across the deserts of the Territory by the writhing\r\nserpent of dust it lifted up.  By these wagons, freights over that\r\nhundred and fifty miles were $200 a ton for small lots (same price for\r\nall express matter brought by stage), and $100 a ton for full loads.\r\nOne Virginia firm received one hundred tons of freight a month, and paid\r\n$10,000 a month freightage.  In the winter the freights were much higher.\r\nAll the bullion was shipped in bars by stage to San Francisco (a bar was\r\nusually about twice the size of a pig of lead and contained from $1,500\r\nto $3,000 according to the amount of gold mixed with the silver), and the\r\nfreight on it (when the shipment was large) was one and a quarter per\r\ncent. of its intrinsic value.\r\n\r\nSo, the freight on these bars probably averaged something more than $25\r\neach.  Small shippers paid two per cent.  There were three stages a day,\r\neach way, and I have seen the out-going stages carry away a third of a\r\nton of bullion each, and more than once I saw them divide a two-ton lot\r\nand take it off.  However, these were extraordinary events.\r\n[Mr. Valentine, Wells Fargo\'s agent, has handled all the bullion shipped\r\nthrough the Virginia office for many a month.  To his memory--which is\r\nexcellent--we are indebted for the following exhibit of the company\'s\r\nbusiness in the Virginia office since the first of January, 1862: From\r\nJanuary 1st to April 1st, about $270,000 worth of bullion passed through\r\nthat office, during the next quarter, $570,000; next quarter, $800,000;\r\nnext quarter, $956,000; next quarter, $1,275,000; and for the quarter\r\nending on the 30th of last June, about $1,600,000.  Thus in a year and a\r\nhalf, the Virginia office only shipped $5,330,000 in bullion.  During the\r\nyear 1862 they shipped $2,615,000, so we perceive the average shipments\r\nhave more than doubled in the last six months.  This gives us room to\r\npromise for the Virginia office $500,000 a month for the year 1863\r\n(though perhaps, judging by the steady increase in the business, we are\r\nunder estimating, somewhat).  This gives us $6,000,000 for the year.\r\nGold Hill and Silver City together can beat us--we will give them\r\n$10,000,000.  To Dayton, Empire City, Ophir and Carson City, we will\r\nallow an aggregate of $8,000,000, which is not over the mark, perhaps,\r\nand may possibly be a little under it.  To Esmeralda we give $4,000,000.\r\nTo Reese River and Humboldt $2,000,000, which is liberal now, but may not\r\nbe before the year is out.  So we prognosticate that the yield of bullion\r\nthis year will be about $30,000,000.  Placing the number of mills in the\r\nTerritory at one hundred, this gives to each the labor of producing\r\n$300,000 in bullion during the twelve months.  Allowing them to run three\r\nhundred days in the year (which none of them more than do), this makes\r\ntheir work average $1,000 a day.  Say the mills average twenty tons of\r\nrock a day and this rock worth $50 as a general thing, and you have the\r\nactual work of our one hundred mills figured down "to a spot"--$1,000 a\r\nday each, and $30,000,000 a year in the aggregate.--Enterprise.\r\n[A considerable over estimate--M.  T.]]\r\n\r\nTwo tons of silver bullion would be in the neighborhood of forty bars,\r\nand the freight on it over $1,000.  Each coach always carried a deal of\r\nordinary express matter beside, and also from fifteen to twenty\r\npassengers at from $25 to $30 a head.  With six stages going all the\r\ntime, Wells, Fargo and Co.\'s Virginia City business was important and\r\nlucrative.\r\n\r\nAll along under the centre of Virginia and Gold Hill, for a couple of\r\nmiles, ran the great Comstock silver lode--a vein of ore from fifty to\r\neighty feet thick between its solid walls of rock--a vein as wide as some\r\nof New York\'s streets.  I will remind the reader that in Pennsylvania a\r\ncoal vein only eight feet wide is considered ample.\r\n\r\nVirginia was a busy city of streets and houses above ground.  Under it\r\nwas another busy city, down in the bowels of the earth, where a great\r\npopulation of men thronged in and out among an intricate maze of tunnels\r\nand drifts, flitting hither and thither under a winking sparkle of\r\nlights, and over their heads towered a vast web of interlocking timbers\r\nthat held the walls of the gutted Comstock apart.  These timbers were as\r\nlarge as a man\'s body, and the framework stretched upward so far that no\r\neye could pierce to its top through the closing gloom.  It was like\r\npeering up through the clean-picked ribs and bones of some colossal\r\nskeleton.  Imagine such a framework two miles long, sixty feet wide, and\r\nhigher than any church spire in America.  Imagine this stately\r\nlattice-work stretching down Broadway, from the St. Nicholas to Wall\r\nstreet, and a Fourth of July procession, reduced to pigmies, parading on\r\ntop of it and flaunting their flags, high above the pinnacle of Trinity\r\nsteeple. One can imagine that, but he cannot well imagine what that\r\nforest of timbers cost, from the time they were felled in the pineries\r\nbeyond Washoe Lake, hauled up and around Mount Davidson at atrocious\r\nrates of freightage, then squared, let down into the deep maw of the mine\r\nand built up there.  Twenty ample fortunes would not timber one of the\r\ngreatest of those silver mines.  The Spanish proverb says it requires a\r\ngold mine to "run" a silver one, and it is true.  A beggar with a silver\r\nmine is a pitiable pauper indeed if he cannot sell.\r\n\r\nI spoke of the underground Virginia as a city.  The Gould and Curry is\r\nonly one single mine under there, among a great many others; yet the\r\nGould and Curry\'s streets of dismal drifts and tunnels were five miles in\r\nextent, altogether, and its population five hundred miners.  Taken as a\r\nwhole, the underground city had some thirty miles of streets and a\r\npopulation of five or six thousand.  In this present day some of those\r\npopulations are at work from twelve to sixteen hundred feet under\r\nVirginia and Gold Hill, and the signal-bells that tell them what the\r\nsuperintendent above ground desires them to do are struck by telegraph as\r\nwe strike a fire alarm.  Sometimes men fall down a shaft, there, a\r\nthousand feet deep.  In such cases, the usual plan is to hold an inquest.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to visit one of those mines, you may walk through a tunnel\r\nabout half a mile long if you prefer it, or you may take the quicker plan\r\nof shooting like a dart down a shaft, on a small platform.  It is like\r\ntumbling down through an empty steeple, feet first.  When you reach the\r\nbottom, you take a candle and tramp through drifts and tunnels where\r\nthrongs of men are digging and blasting; you watch them send up tubs full\r\nof great lumps of stone--silver ore; you select choice specimens from the\r\nmass, as souvenirs; you admire the world of skeleton timbering; you\r\nreflect frequently that you are buried under a mountain, a thousand feet\r\nbelow daylight; being in the bottom of the mine you climb from "gallery"\r\nto "gallery," up endless ladders that stand straight up and down; when\r\nyour legs fail you at last, you lie down in a small box-car in a cramped\r\n"incline" like a half-up-ended sewer and are dragged up to daylight\r\nfeeling as if you are crawling through a coffin that has no end to it.\r\nArrived at the top, you find a busy crowd of men receiving the ascending\r\ncars and tubs and dumping the ore from an elevation into long rows of\r\nbins capable of holding half a dozen tons each; under the bins are rows\r\nof wagons loading from chutes and trap-doors in the bins, and down the\r\nlong street is a procession of these wagons wending toward the silver\r\nmills with their rich freight.  It is all "done," now, and there you are.\r\nYou need never go down again, for you have seen it all.  If you have\r\nforgotten the process of reducing the ore in the mill and making the\r\nsilver bars, you can go back and find it again in my Esmeralda chapters\r\nif so disposed.\r\n\r\nOf course these mines cave in, in places, occasionally, and then it is\r\nworth one\'s while to take the risk of descending into them and observing\r\nthe crushing power exerted by the pressing weight of a settling mountain.\r\nI published such an experience in the Enterprise, once, and from it I\r\nwill take an extract:\r\n\r\n      AN HOUR IN THE CAVED MINES.--We journeyed down into the Ophir mine,\r\n      yesterday, to see the earthquake.  We could not go down the deep\r\n      incline, because it still has a propensity to cave in places.\r\n      Therefore we traveled through the long tunnel which enters the hill\r\n      above the Ophir office, and then by means of a series of long\r\n      ladders, climbed away down from the first to the fourth gallery.\r\n      Traversing a drift, we came to the Spanish line, passed five sets of\r\n      timbers still uninjured, and found the earthquake.  Here was as\r\n      complete a chaos as ever was seen--vast masses of earth and\r\n      splintered and broken timbers piled confusedly together, with\r\n      scarcely an aperture left large enough for a cat to creep through.\r\n      Rubbish was still falling at intervals from above, and one timber\r\n      which had braced others earlier in the day, was now crushed down out\r\n      of its former position, showing that the caving and settling of the\r\n      tremendous mass was still going on.  We were in that portion of the\r\n      Ophir known as the "north mines."  Returning to the surface, we\r\n      entered a tunnel leading into the Central, for the purpose of\r\n      getting into the main Ophir.  Descending a long incline in this\r\n      tunnel, we traversed a drift or so, and then went down a deep shaft\r\n      from whence we proceeded into the fifth gallery of the Ophir.  From\r\n      a side-drift we crawled through a small hole and got into the midst\r\n      of the earthquake again--earth and broken timbers mingled together\r\n      without regard to grace or symmetry.  A large portion of the second,\r\n      third and fourth galleries had caved in and gone to destruction--the\r\n      two latter at seven o\'clock on the previous evening.\r\n\r\n      At the turn-table, near the northern extremity of the fifth gallery,\r\n      two big piles of rubbish had forced their way through from the fifth\r\n      gallery, and from the looks of the timbers, more was about to come.\r\n      These beams are solid--eighteen inches square; first, a great beam\r\n      is laid on the floor, then upright ones, five feet high, stand on\r\n      it, supporting another horizontal beam, and so on, square above\r\n      square, like the framework of a window.  The superincumbent weight\r\n      was sufficient to mash the ends of those great upright beams fairly\r\n      into the solid wood of the horizontal ones three inches, compressing\r\n      and bending the upright beam till it curved like a bow.  Before the\r\n      Spanish caved in, some of their twelve-inch horizontal timbers were\r\n      compressed in this way until they were only five inches thick!\r\n      Imagine the power it must take to squeeze a solid log together in\r\n      that way.  Here, also, was a range of timbers, for a distance of\r\n      twenty feet, tilted six inches out of the perpendicular by the\r\n      weight resting upon them from the caved galleries above.  You could\r\n      hear things cracking and giving way, and it was not pleasant to know\r\n      that the world overhead was slowly and silently sinking down upon\r\n      you.  The men down in the mine do not mind it, however.\r\n\r\n      Returning along the fifth gallery, we struck the safe part of the\r\n      Ophir incline, and went down it to the sixth; but we found ten\r\n      inches of water there, and had to come back.  In repairing the\r\n      damage done to the incline, the pump had to be stopped for two\r\n      hours, and in the meantime the water gained about a foot.  However,\r\n      the pump was at work again, and the flood-water was decreasing.\r\n      We climbed up to the fifth gallery again and sought a deep shaft,\r\n      whereby we might descend to another part of the sixth, out of reach\r\n      of the water, but suffered disappointment, as the men had gone to\r\n      dinner, and there was no one to man the windlass.  So, having seen\r\n      the earthquake, we climbed out at the Union incline and tunnel, and\r\n      adjourned, all dripping with candle grease and perspiration, to\r\n      lunch at the Ophir office.\r\n\r\n      During the great flush year of 1863, Nevada [claims to have]\r\n      produced $25,000,000 in bullion--almost, if not quite, a round\r\n      million to each thousand inhabitants, which is very well,\r\n      considering that she was without agriculture and manufactures.\r\n      Silver mining was her sole productive industry. [Since the above was\r\n      in type, I learn from an official source that the above figure is\r\n      too high, and that the yield for 1863 did not exceed $20,000,000.]\r\n      However, the day for large figures is approaching; the Sutro Tunnel\r\n      is to plow through the Comstock lode from end to end, at a depth of\r\n      two thousand feet, and then mining will be easy and comparatively\r\n      inexpensive; and the momentous matters of drainage, and hoisting and\r\n      hauling of ore will cease to be burdensome.  This vast work will\r\n      absorb many years, and millions of dollars, in its completion; but\r\n      it will early yield money, for that desirable epoch will begin as\r\n      soon as it strikes the first end of the vein.  The tunnel will be\r\n      some eight miles long, and will develop astonishing riches.  Cars\r\n      will carry the ore through the tunnel and dump it in the mills and\r\n      thus do away with the present costly system of double handling and\r\n      transportation by mule teams.  The water from the tunnel will\r\n      furnish the motive power for the mills.  Mr. Sutro, the originator\r\n      of this prodigious enterprise, is one of the few men in the world\r\n      who is gifted with the pluck and perseverance necessary to follow up\r\n      and hound such an undertaking to its completion.  He has converted\r\n      several obstinate Congresses to a deserved friendliness toward his\r\n      important work, and has gone up and down and to and fro in Europe\r\n      until he has enlisted a great moneyed interest in it there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then, in these days, the boys used to tell me I ought to\r\nget one Jim Blaine to tell me the stirring story of his grandfather\'s old\r\nram--but they always added that I must not mention the matter unless Jim\r\nwas drunk at the time--just comfortably and sociably drunk.  They kept\r\nthis up until my curiosity was on the rack to hear the story.  I got to\r\nhaunting Blaine; but it was of no use, the boys always found fault with\r\nhis condition; he was often moderately but never satisfactorily drunk.\r\nI never watched a man\'s condition with such absorbing interest, such\r\nanxious solicitude; I never so pined to see a man uncompromisingly drunk\r\nbefore.  At last, one evening I hurried to his cabin, for I learned that\r\nthis time his situation was such that even the most fastidious could find\r\nno fault with it--he was tranquilly, serenely, symmetrically drunk--not a\r\nhiccup to mar his voice, not a cloud upon his brain thick enough to\r\nobscure his memory.  As I entered, he was sitting upon an empty\r\npowder-keg, with a clay pipe in one hand and the other raised to command\r\nsilence.  His face was round, red, and very serious; his throat was bare\r\nand his hair tumbled; in general appearance and costume he was a stalwart\r\nminer of the period.  On the pine table stood a candle, and its dim light\r\nrevealed "the boys" sitting here and there on bunks, candle-boxes,\r\npowder-kegs, etc.  They said:\r\n\r\n"Sh--!  Don\'t speak--he\'s going to commence."\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE STORY OF THE OLD RAM.\r\n\r\nI found a seat at once, and Blaine said:\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t reckon them times will ever come again.  There never was a more\r\nbullier old ram than what he was.  Grandfather fetched him from Illinois\r\n--got him of a man by the name of Yates--Bill Yates--maybe you might have\r\nheard of him; his father was a deacon--Baptist--and he was a rustler,\r\ntoo; a man had to get up ruther early to get the start of old Thankful\r\nYates; it was him that put the Greens up to jining teams with my\r\ngrandfather when he moved west.\r\n\r\n\'Seth Green was prob\'ly the pick of the flock; he married a Wilkerson\r\n--Sarah Wilkerson--good cretur, she was--one of the likeliest heifers that\r\nwas ever raised in old Stoddard, everybody said that knowed her.  She\r\ncould heft a bar\'l of flour as easy as I can flirt a flapjack.  And spin?\r\nDon\'t mention it!  Independent?  Humph!  When Sile Hawkins come a\r\nbrowsing around her, she let him know that for all his tin he couldn\'t\r\ntrot in harness alongside of her.  You see, Sile Hawkins was--no, it\r\nwarn\'t Sile Hawkins, after all--it was a galoot by the name of Filkins\r\n--I disremember his first name; but he was a stump--come into pra\'r meeting\r\ndrunk, one night, hooraying for Nixon, becuz he thought it was a primary;\r\nand old deacon Ferguson up and scooted him through the window and he lit\r\non old Miss Jefferson\'s head, poor old filly.  She was a good soul--had a\r\nglass eye and used to lend it to old Miss Wagner, that hadn\'t any, to\r\nreceive company in; it warn\'t big enough, and when Miss Wagner warn\'t\r\nnoticing, it would get twisted around in the socket, and look up, maybe,\r\nor out to one side, and every which way, while t\' other one was looking\r\nas straight ahead as a spy-glass.\r\n\r\n\'Grown people didn\'t mind it, but it most always made the children cry, it\r\nwas so sort of scary.  She tried packing it in raw cotton, but it\r\nwouldn\'t work, somehow--the cotton would get loose and stick out and look\r\nso kind of awful that the children couldn\'t stand it no way.  She was\r\nalways dropping it out, and turning up her old dead-light on the company\r\nempty, and making them oncomfortable, becuz she never could tell when it\r\nhopped out, being blind on that side, you see.  So somebody would have to\r\nhunch her and say, "Your game eye has fetched loose.  Miss Wagner dear"\r\n--and then all of them would have to sit and wait till she jammed it in\r\nagain--wrong side before, as a general thing, and green as a bird\'s egg,\r\nbeing a bashful cretur and easy sot back before company.  But being wrong\r\nside before warn\'t much difference, anyway; becuz her own eye was\r\nsky-blue and the glass one was yaller on the front side, so whichever way\r\nshe turned it it didn\'t match nohow.\r\n\r\n\'Old Miss Wagner was considerable on the borrow, she was.  When she had a\r\nquilting, or Dorcas S\'iety at her house she gen\'ally borrowed Miss\r\nHiggins\'s wooden leg to stump around on; it was considerable shorter than\r\nher other pin, but much she minded that.  She said she couldn\'t abide\r\ncrutches when she had company, becuz they were so slow; said when she had\r\ncompany and things had to be done, she wanted to get up and hump herself.\r\nShe was as bald as a jug, and so she used to borrow Miss Jacops\'s wig\r\n--Miss Jacops was the coffin-peddler\'s wife--a ratty old buzzard, he was,\r\nthat used to go roosting around where people was sick, waiting for \'em;\r\nand there that old rip would sit all day, in the shade, on a coffin that\r\nhe judged would fit the can\'idate; and if it was a slow customer and kind\r\nof uncertain, he\'d fetch his rations and a blanket along and sleep in the\r\ncoffin nights.  He was anchored out that way, in frosty weather, for\r\nabout three weeks, once, before old Robbins\'s place, waiting for him; and\r\nafter that, for as much as two years, Jacops was not on speaking terms\r\nwith the old man, on account of his disapp\'inting him.  He got one of his\r\nfeet froze, and lost money, too, becuz old Robbins took a favorable turn\r\nand got well.  The next time Robbins got sick, Jacops tried to make up\r\nwith him, and varnished up the same old coffin and fetched it along; but\r\nold Robbins was too many for him; he had him in, and \'peared to be\r\npowerful weak; he bought the coffin for ten dollars and Jacops was to pay\r\nit back and twenty-five more besides if Robbins didn\'t like the coffin\r\nafter he\'d tried it.  And then Robbins died, and at the funeral he\r\nbursted off the lid and riz up in his shroud and told the parson to let\r\nup on the performances, becuz he could not stand such a coffin as that.\r\nYou see he had been in a trance once before, when he was young, and he\r\ntook the chances on another, cal\'lating that if he made the trip it was\r\nmoney in his pocket, and if he missed fire he couldn\'t lose a cent.  And\r\nby George he sued Jacops for the rhino and got jedgment; and he set up\r\nthe coffin in his back parlor and said he \'lowed to take his time, now.\r\nIt was always an aggravation to Jacops, the way that miserable old thing\r\nacted.  He moved back to Indiany pretty soon--went to Wellsville\r\n--Wellsville was the place the Hogadorns was from.  Mighty fine family.\r\nOld Maryland stock.  Old Squire Hogadorn could carry around more mixed\r\nlicker, and cuss better than most any man I ever see.  His second wife\r\nwas the widder Billings--she that was Becky Martin; her dam was deacon\r\nDunlap\'s first wife.  Her oldest child, Maria, married a missionary and\r\ndied in grace--et up by the savages.  They et him, too, poor feller\r\n--biled him.  It warn\'t the custom, so they say, but they explained to\r\nfriends of his\'n that went down there to bring away his things, that\r\nthey\'d tried missionaries every other way and never could get any good\r\nout of \'em--and so it annoyed all his relations to find out that that\r\nman\'s life was fooled away just out of a dern\'d experiment, so to speak.\r\nBut mind you, there ain\'t anything ever reely lost; everything that\r\npeople can\'t understand and don\'t see the reason of does good if you only\r\nhold on and give it a fair shake; Prov\'dence don\'t fire no blank\r\nca\'tridges, boys.  That there missionary\'s substance, unbeknowns to\r\nhimself, actu\'ly converted every last one of them heathens that took a\r\nchance at the barbacue.  Nothing ever fetched them but that.  Don\'t tell\r\nme it was an accident that he was biled.  There ain\'t no such a thing as\r\nan accident.\r\n\r\n\'When my uncle Lem was leaning up agin a scaffolding once, sick, or drunk,\r\nor suthin, an Irishman with a hod full of bricks fell on him out of the\r\nthird story and broke the old man\'s back in two places.  People said it\r\nwas an accident.  Much accident there was about that.  He didn\'t know\r\nwhat he was there for, but he was there for a good object.  If he hadn\'t\r\nbeen there the Irishman would have been killed.  Nobody can ever make me\r\nbelieve anything different from that.  Uncle Lem\'s dog was there.  Why\r\ndidn\'t the Irishman fall on the dog?  Becuz the dog would a seen him a\r\ncoming and stood from under.  That\'s the reason the dog warn\'t appinted.\r\nA dog can\'t be depended on to carry out a special providence.  Mark my\r\nwords it was a put-up thing.  Accidents don\'t happen, boys.  Uncle Lem\'s\r\ndog--I wish you could a seen that dog.  He was a reglar shepherd--or\r\nruther he was part bull and part shepherd--splendid animal; belonged to\r\nparson Hagar before Uncle Lem got him.  Parson Hagar belonged to the\r\nWestern Reserve Hagars; prime family; his mother was a Watson; one of his\r\nsisters married a Wheeler; they settled in Morgan county, and he got\r\nnipped by the machinery in a carpet factory and went through in less than\r\na quarter of a minute; his widder bought the piece of carpet that had his\r\nremains wove in, and people come a hundred mile to \'tend the funeral.\r\nThere was fourteen yards in the piece.\r\n\r\n\'She wouldn\'t let them roll him up, but planted him just so--full length.\r\nThe church was middling small where they preached the funeral, and they\r\nhad to let one end of the coffin stick out of the window.  They didn\'t\r\nbury him--they planted one end, and let him stand up, same as a monument.\r\nAnd they nailed a sign on it and put--put on--put on it--sacred to--the\r\nm-e-m-o-r-y--of fourteen y-a-r-d-s--of three-ply--car---pet--containing\r\nall that was--m-o-r-t-a-l--of--of--W-i-l-l-i-a-m--W-h-e--\'\r\n\r\nJim Blaine had been growing gradually drowsy and drowsier--his head\r\nnodded, once, twice, three times--dropped peacefully upon his breast, and\r\nhe fell tranquilly asleep.  The tears were running down the boys\' cheeks\r\n--they were suffocating with suppressed laughter--and had been from the\r\nstart, though I had never noticed it.  I perceived that I was "sold."\r\nI learned then that Jim Blaine\'s peculiarity was that whenever he reached\r\na certain stage of intoxication, no human power could keep him from\r\nsetting out, with impressive unction, to tell about a wonderful adventure\r\nwhich he had once had with his grandfather\'s old ram--and the mention of\r\nthe ram in the first sentence was as far as any man had ever heard him\r\nget, concerning it.  He always maundered off, interminably, from one\r\nthing to another, till his whisky got the best of him and he fell asleep.\r\nWhat the thing was that happened to him and his grandfather\'s old ram is\r\na dark mystery to this day, for nobody has ever yet found out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\nOf course there was a large Chinese population in Virginia--it is the\r\ncase with every town and city on the Pacific coast.  They are a harmless\r\nrace when white men either let them alone or treat them no worse than\r\ndogs; in fact they are almost entirely harmless anyhow, for they seldom\r\nthink of resenting the vilest insults or the cruelest injuries.  They are\r\nquiet, peaceable, tractable, free from drunkenness, and they are as\r\nindustrious as the day is long.  A disorderly Chinaman is rare, and a\r\nlazy one does not exist.  So long as a Chinaman has strength to use his\r\nhands he needs no support from anybody; white men often complain of want\r\nof work, but a Chinaman offers no such complaint; he always manages to\r\nfind something to do.  He is a great convenience to everybody--even to\r\nthe worst class of white men, for he bears the most of their sins,\r\nsuffering fines for their petty thefts, imprisonment for their robberies,\r\nand death for their murders.  Any white man can swear a Chinaman\'s life\r\naway in the courts, but no Chinaman can testify against a white man.\r\nOurs is the "land of the free"--nobody denies that--nobody challenges it.\r\n[Maybe it is because we won\'t let other people testify.] As I write, news\r\ncomes that in broad daylight in San Francisco, some boys have stoned an\r\ninoffensive Chinaman to death, and that although a large crowd witnessed\r\nthe shameful deed, no one interfered.\r\n\r\nThere are seventy thousand (and possibly one hundred thousand) Chinamen\r\non the Pacific coast.  There were about a thousand in Virginia.  They\r\nwere penned into a "Chinese quarter"--a thing which they do not\r\nparticularly object to, as they are fond of herding together.  Their\r\nbuildings were of wood; usually only one story high, and set thickly\r\ntogether along streets scarcely wide enough for a wagon to pass through.\r\nTheir quarter was a little removed from the rest of the town.  The chief\r\nemployment of Chinamen in towns is to wash clothing.  They always send a\r\nbill, like this below, pinned to the clothes.  It is mere ceremony, for\r\nit does not enlighten the customer much.  Their price for washing was\r\n$2.50 per dozen--rather cheaper than white people could afford to wash\r\nfor at that time.  A very common sign on the Chinese houses was: "See\r\nYup, Washer and Ironer"; "Hong Wo, Washer"; "Sam Sing & Ah Hop, Washing."\r\nThe house servants, cooks, etc., in California and Nevada, were chiefly\r\nChinamen.  There were few white servants and no Chinawomen so employed.\r\nChinamen make good house servants, being quick, obedient, patient, quick\r\nto learn and tirelessly industrious.  They do not need to be taught a\r\nthing twice, as a general thing.  They are imitative.  If a Chinaman were\r\nto see his master break up a centre table, in a passion, and kindle a\r\nfire with it, that Chinaman would be likely to resort to the furniture\r\nfor fuel forever afterward.\r\n\r\nAll Chinamen can read, write and cipher with easy facility--pity but all\r\nour petted voters could.  In California they rent little patches of\r\nground and do a deal of gardening.  They will raise surprising crops of\r\nvegetables on a sand pile.  They waste nothing.  What is rubbish to a\r\nChristian, a Chinaman carefully preserves and makes useful in one way or\r\nanother.  He gathers up all the old oyster and sardine cans that white\r\npeople throw away, and procures marketable tin and solder from them by\r\nmelting.  He gathers up old bones and turns them into manure.\r\nIn California he gets a living out of old mining claims that white men\r\nhave abandoned as exhausted and worthless--and then the officers come\r\ndown on him once a month with an exorbitant swindle to which the\r\nlegislature has given the broad, general name of "foreign" mining tax,\r\nbut it is usually inflicted on no foreigners but Chinamen.  This swindle\r\nhas in some cases been repeated once or twice on the same victim in the\r\ncourse of the same month--but the public treasury was no additionally\r\nenriched by it, probably.\r\n\r\nChinamen hold their dead in great reverence--they worship their departed\r\nancestors, in fact.  Hence, in China, a man\'s front yard, back yard, or\r\nany other part of his premises, is made his family burying ground, in\r\norder that he may visit the graves at any and all times.  Therefore that\r\nhuge empire is one mighty cemetery; it is ridged and wringled from its\r\ncentre to its circumference with graves--and inasmuch as every foot of\r\nground must be made to do its utmost, in China, lest the swarming\r\npopulation suffer for food, the very graves are cultivated and yield a\r\nharvest, custom holding this to be no dishonor to the dead.  Since the\r\ndeparted are held in such worshipful reverence, a Chinaman cannot bear\r\nthat any indignity be offered the places where they sleep.\r\nMr. Burlingame said that herein lay China\'s bitter opposition to\r\nrailroads; a road could not be built anywhere in the empire without\r\ndisturbing the graves of their ancestors or friends.\r\n\r\nA Chinaman hardly believes he could enjoy the hereafter except his body\r\nlay in his beloved China; also, he desires to receive, himself, after\r\ndeath, that worship with which he has honored his dead that preceded him.\r\nTherefore, if he visits a foreign country, he makes arrangements to have\r\nhis bones returned to China in case he dies; if he hires to go to a\r\nforeign country on a labor contract, there is always a stipulation that\r\nhis body shall be taken back to China if he dies; if the government sells\r\na gang of Coolies to a foreigner for the usual five-year term, it is\r\nspecified in the contract that their bodies shall be restored to China in\r\ncase of death.  On the Pacific coast the Chinamen all belong to one or\r\nanother of several great companies or organizations, and these companies\r\nkeep track of their members, register their names, and ship their bodies\r\nhome when they die.  The See Yup Company is held to be the largest of\r\nthese.  The Ning Yeong Company is next, and numbers eighteen thousand\r\nmembers on the coast.  Its headquarters are at San Francisco, where it\r\nhas a costly temple, several great officers (one of whom keeps regal\r\nstate in seclusion and cannot be approached by common humanity), and a\r\nnumerous priesthood.  In it I was shown a register of its members, with\r\nthe dead and the date of their shipment to China duly marked.  Every ship\r\nthat sails from San Francisco carries away a heavy freight of Chinese\r\ncorpses--or did, at least, until the legislature, with an ingenious\r\nrefinement of Christian cruelty, forbade the shipments, as a neat\r\nunderhanded way of deterring Chinese immigration.  The bill was offered,\r\nwhether it passed or not.  It is my impression that it passed.  There was\r\nanother bill--it became a law--compelling every incoming Chinaman to be\r\nvaccinated on the wharf and pay a duly appointed quack (no decent doctor\r\nwould defile himself with such legalized robbery) ten dollars for it.\r\nAs few importers of Chinese would want to go to an expense like that, the\r\nlaw-makers thought this would be another heavy blow to Chinese\r\nimmigration.\r\n\r\nWhat the Chinese quarter of Virginia was like--or, indeed, what the\r\nChinese quarter of any Pacific coast town was and is like--may be\r\ngathered from this item which I printed in the Enterprise while reporting\r\nfor that paper:\r\n\r\n      CHINATOWN.--Accompanied by a fellow reporter, we made a trip through\r\n      our Chinese quarter the other night.  The Chinese have built their\r\n      portion of the city to suit themselves; and as they keep neither\r\n      carriages nor wagons, their streets are not wide enough, as a\r\n      general thing, to admit of the passage of vehicles.  At ten o\'clock\r\n      at night the Chinaman may be seen in all his glory.  In every little\r\n      cooped-up, dingy cavern of a hut, faint with the odor of burning\r\n      Josh-lights and with nothing to see the gloom by save the sickly,\r\n      guttering tallow candle, were two or three yellow, long-tailed\r\n      vagabonds, coiled up on a sort of short truckle-bed, smoking opium,\r\n      motionless and with their lustreless eyes turned inward from excess\r\n      of satisfaction--or rather the recent smoker looks thus, immediately\r\n      after having passed the pipe to his neighbor--for opium-smoking is a\r\n      comfortless operation, and requires constant attention.  A lamp sits\r\n      on the bed, the length of the long pipe-stem from the smoker\'s\r\n      mouth; he puts a pellet of opium on the end of a wire, sets it on\r\n      fire, and plasters it into the pipe much as a Christian would fill a\r\n      hole with putty; then he applies the bowl to the lamp and proceeds\r\n      to smoke--and the stewing and frying of the drug and the gurgling of\r\n      the juices in the stem would well-nigh turn the stomach of a statue.\r\n      John likes it, though; it soothes him, he takes about two dozen\r\n      whiffs, and then rolls over to dream, Heaven only knows what, for we\r\n      could not imagine by looking at the soggy creature.  Possibly in his\r\n      visions he travels far away from the gross world and his regular\r\n      washing, and feast on succulent rats and birds\'-nests in Paradise.\r\n\r\nMr. Ah Sing keeps a general grocery and provision store at No.  13 Wang\r\nstreet.  He lavished his hospitality upon our party in the friendliest\r\nway.  He had various kinds of colored and colorless wines and brandies,\r\nwith unpronouncable names, imported from China in little crockery jugs,\r\nand which he offered to us in dainty little miniature wash-basins of\r\nporcelain.  He offered us a mess of birds\'-nests; also, small, neat\r\nsausages, of which we could have swallowed several yards if we had chosen\r\nto try, but we suspected that each link contained the corpse of a mouse,\r\nand therefore refrained.  Mr. Sing had in his store a thousand articles\r\nof merchandise, curious to behold, impossible to imagine the uses of, and\r\nbeyond our ability to describe.\r\n\r\nHis ducks, however, and his eggs, we could understand; the former were\r\nsplit open and flattened out like codfish, and came from China in that\r\nshape, and the latter were plastered over with some kind of paste which\r\nkept them fresh and palatable through the long voyage.\r\n\r\nWe found Mr. Hong Wo, No. 37 Chow-chow street, making up a lottery\r\nscheme--in fact we found a dozen others occupied in the same way in\r\nvarious parts of the quarter, for about every third Chinaman runs a\r\nlottery, and the balance of the tribe "buck" at it.  "Tom," who speaks\r\nfaultless English, and used to be chief and only cook to the Territorial\r\nEnterprise, when the establishment kept bachelor\'s hall two years ago,\r\nsaid that "Sometime Chinaman buy ticket one dollar hap, ketch um two tree\r\nhundred, sometime no ketch um anything; lottery like one man fight um\r\nseventy--may-be he whip, may-be he get whip heself, welly good."\r\n\r\nHowever, the percentage being sixty-nine against him, the chances are,\r\nas a general thing, that "he get whip heself."  We could not see that\r\nthese lotteries differed in any respect from our own, save that the\r\nfigures being Chinese, no ignorant white man might ever hope to succeed\r\nin telling "t\'other from which;" the manner of drawing is similar to\r\nours.\r\n\r\nMr. See Yup keeps a fancy store on Live Fox street.  He sold us fans of\r\nwhite feathers, gorgeously ornamented; perfumery that smelled like\r\nLimburger cheese, Chinese pens, and watch-charms made of a stone\r\nunscratchable with steel instruments, yet polished and tinted like the\r\ninner coat of a sea-shell.  As tokens of his esteem, See Yup presented\r\nthe party with gaudy plumes made of gold tinsel and trimmed with\r\npeacocks\' feathers.\r\n\r\nWe ate chow-chow with chop-sticks in the celestial restaurants; our\r\ncomrade chided the moon-eyed damsels in front of the houses for their\r\nwant of feminine reserve; we received protecting Josh-lights from our\r\nhosts and "dickered" for a pagan God or two.  Finally, we were impressed\r\nwith the genius of a Chinese book-keeper; he figured up his accounts on a\r\nmachine like a gridiron with buttons strung on its bars; the different\r\nrows represented units, tens, hundreds and thousands.  He fingered them\r\nwith incredible rapidity--in fact, he pushed them from place to place as\r\nfast as a musical professor\'s fingers travel over the keys of a piano.\r\n\r\nThey are a kindly disposed, well-meaning race, and are respected and well\r\ntreated by the upper classes, all over the Pacific coast.  No Californian\r\ngentleman or lady ever abuses or oppresses a Chinaman, under any\r\ncircumstances, an explanation that seems to be much needed in the East.\r\nOnly the scum of the population do it--they and their children; they,\r\nand, naturally and consistently, the policemen and politicians, likewise,\r\nfor these are the dust-licking pimps and slaves of the scum, there as\r\nwell as elsewhere in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\nI began to get tired of staying in one place so long.\r\n\r\nThere was no longer satisfying variety in going down to Carson to report\r\nthe proceedings of the legislature once a year, and horse-races and\r\npumpkin-shows once in three months; (they had got to raising pumpkins and\r\npotatoes in Washoe Valley, and of course one of the first achievements of\r\nthe legislature was to institute a ten-thousand-dollar Agricultural Fair\r\nto show off forty dollars\' worth of those pumpkins in--however, the\r\nterritorial legislature was usually spoken of as the "asylum").  I wanted\r\nto see San Francisco.  I wanted to go somewhere.  I wanted--I did not\r\nknow what I wanted.  I had the "spring fever" and wanted a change,\r\nprincipally, no doubt.  Besides, a convention had framed a State\r\nConstitution; nine men out of every ten wanted an office; I believed that\r\nthese gentlemen would "treat" the moneyless and the irresponsible among\r\nthe population into adopting the constitution and thus well-nigh killing\r\nthe country (it could not well carry such a load as a State government,\r\nsince it had nothing to tax that could stand a tax, for undeveloped mines\r\ncould not, and there were not fifty developed ones in the land, there was\r\nbut little realty to tax, and it did seem as if nobody was ever going to\r\nthink of the simple salvation of inflicting a money penalty on murder).\r\nI believed that a State government would destroy the "flush times," and I\r\nwanted to get away.  I believed that the mining stocks I had on hand\r\nwould soon be worth $100,000, and thought if they reached that before the\r\nConstitution was adopted, I would sell out and make myself secure from\r\nthe crash the change of government was going to bring.  I considered\r\n$100,000 sufficient to go home with decently, though it was but a small\r\namount compared to what I had been expecting to return with.  I felt\r\nrather down-hearted about it, but I tried to comfort myself with the\r\nreflection that with such a sum I could not fall into want.  About this\r\ntime a schoolmate of mine whom I had not seen since boyhood, came\r\ntramping in on foot from Reese River, a very allegory of Poverty.\r\nThe son of wealthy parents, here he was, in a strange land, hungry,\r\nbootless, mantled in an ancient horse-blanket, roofed with a brimless\r\nhat, and so generally and so extravagantly dilapidated that he could have\r\n"taken the shine out of the Prodigal Son himself," as he pleasantly\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to borrow forty-six dollars--twenty-six to take him to San\r\nFrancisco, and twenty for something else; to buy some soap with, maybe,\r\nfor he needed it.  I found I had but little more than the amount wanted,\r\nin my pocket; so I stepped in and borrowed forty-six dollars of a banker\r\n(on twenty days\' time, without the formality of a note), and gave it him,\r\nrather than walk half a block to the office, where I had some specie laid\r\nup.  If anybody had told me that it would take me two years to pay back\r\nthat forty-six dollars to the banker (for I did not expect it of the\r\nProdigal, and was not disappointed), I would have felt injured.  And so\r\nwould the banker.\r\n\r\nI wanted a change.  I wanted variety of some kind.  It came.  Mr. Goodman\r\nwent away for a week and left me the post of chief editor.  It destroyed\r\nme.  The first day, I wrote my "leader" in the forenoon.  The second day,\r\nI had no subject and put it off till the afternoon.  The third day I put\r\nit off till evening, and then copied an elaborate editorial out of the\r\n"American Cyclopedia," that steadfast friend of the editor, all over this\r\nland.  The fourth day I "fooled around" till midnight, and then fell back\r\non the Cyclopedia again.  The fifth day I cudgeled my brain till\r\nmidnight, and then kept the press waiting while I penned some bitter\r\npersonalities on six different people.  The sixth day I labored in\r\nanguish till far into the night and brought forth--nothing.  The paper\r\nwent to press without an editorial.  The seventh day I resigned.  On the\r\neighth, Mr. Goodman returned and found six duels on his hands--my\r\npersonalities had borne fruit.\r\n\r\nNobody, except he has tried it, knows what it is to be an editor.  It is\r\neasy to scribble local rubbish, with the facts all before you; it is easy\r\nto clip selections from other papers; it is easy to string out a\r\ncorrespondence from any locality; but it is unspeakable hardship to write\r\neditorials.  Subjects are the trouble--the dreary lack of them, I mean.\r\nEvery day, it is drag, drag, drag--think, and worry and suffer--all the\r\nworld is a dull blank, and yet the editorial columns must be filled.\r\nOnly give the editor a subject, and his work is done--it is no trouble to\r\nwrite it up; but fancy how you would feel if you had to pump your brains\r\ndry every day in the week, fifty-two weeks in the year.  It makes one low\r\nspirited simply to think of it.  The matter that each editor of a daily\r\npaper in America writes in the course of a year would fill from four to\r\neight bulky volumes like this book!  Fancy what a library an editor\'s\r\nwork would make, after twenty or thirty years\' service.  Yet people often\r\nmarvel that Dickens, Scott, Bulwer, Dumas, etc., have been able to\r\nproduce so many books.  If these authors had wrought as voluminously as\r\nnewspaper editors do, the result would be something to marvel at, indeed.\r\nHow editors can continue this tremendous labor, this exhausting\r\nconsumption of brain fibre (for their work is creative, and not a mere\r\nmechanical laying-up of facts, like reporting), day after day and year\r\nafter year, is incomprehensible.  Preachers take two months\' holiday in\r\nmidsummer, for they find that to produce two sermons a week is wearing,\r\nin the long run.  In truth it must be so, and is so; and therefore, how\r\nan editor can take from ten to twenty texts and build upon them from ten\r\nto twenty painstaking editorials a week and keep it up all the year\r\nround, is farther beyond comprehension than ever.  Ever since I survived\r\nmy week as editor, I have found at least one pleasure in any newspaper\r\nthat comes to my hand; it is in admiring the long columns of editorial,\r\nand wondering to myself how in the mischief he did it!\r\n\r\nMr. Goodman\'s return relieved me of employment, unless I chose to become\r\na reporter again.  I could not do that; I could not serve in the ranks\r\nafter being General of the army.  So I thought I would depart and go\r\nabroad into the world somewhere.  Just at this juncture, Dan, my\r\nassociate in the reportorial department, told me, casually, that two\r\ncitizens had been trying to persuade him to go with them to New York and\r\naid in selling a rich silver mine which they had discovered and secured\r\nin a new mining district in our neighborhood.  He said they offered to\r\npay his expenses and give him one third of the proceeds of the sale.\r\nHe had refused to go.  It was the very opportunity I wanted.  I abused\r\nhim for keeping so quiet about it, and not mentioning it sooner.  He said\r\nit had not occurred to him that I would like to go, and so he had\r\nrecommended them to apply to Marshall, the reporter of the other paper.\r\nI asked Dan if it was a good, honest mine, and no swindle.  He said the\r\nmen had shown him nine tons of the rock, which they had got out to take\r\nto New York, and he could cheerfully say that he had seen but little rock\r\nin Nevada that was richer; and moreover, he said that they had secured a\r\ntract of valuable timber and a mill-site, near the mine.  My first idea\r\nwas to kill Dan.  But I changed my mind, notwithstanding I was so angry,\r\nfor I thought maybe the chance was not yet lost.  Dan said it was by no\r\nmeans lost; that the men were absent at the mine again, and would not be\r\nin Virginia to leave for the East for some ten days; that they had\r\nrequested him to do the talking to Marshall, and he had promised that he\r\nwould either secure Marshall or somebody else for them by the time they\r\ngot back; he would now say nothing to anybody till they returned, and\r\nthen fulfil his promise by furnishing me to them.\r\n\r\nIt was splendid.  I went to bed all on fire with excitement; for nobody\r\nhad yet gone East to sell a Nevada silver mine, and the field was white\r\nfor the sickle.  I felt that such a mine as the one described by Dan\r\nwould bring a princely sum in New York, and sell without delay or\r\ndifficulty.  I could not sleep, my fancy so rioted through its castles in\r\nthe air.  It was the "blind lead" come again.\r\n\r\nNext day I got away, on the coach, with the usual eclat attending\r\ndepartures of old citizens,--for if you have only half a dozen friends\r\nout there they will make noise for a hundred rather than let you seem to\r\ngo away neglected and unregretted--and Dan promised to keep strict watch\r\nfor the men that had the mine to sell.\r\n\r\nThe trip was signalized but by one little incident, and that occurred\r\njust as we were about to start.  A very seedy looking vagabond passenger\r\ngot out of the stage a moment to wait till the usual ballast of silver\r\nbricks was thrown in.  He was standing on the pavement, when an awkward\r\nexpress employee, carrying a brick weighing a hundred pounds, stumbled\r\nand let it fall on the bummer\'s foot.  He instantly dropped on the ground\r\nand began to howl in the most heart-breaking way.  A sympathizing crowd\r\ngathered around and were going to pull his boot off; but he screamed\r\nlouder than ever and they desisted; then he fell to gasping, and between\r\nthe gasps ejaculated "Brandy!  for Heaven\'s sake, brandy!"  They poured\r\nhalf a pint down him, and it wonderfully restored and comforted him.\r\nThen he begged the people to assist him to the stage, which was done.\r\nThe express people urged him to have a doctor at their expense, but he\r\ndeclined, and said that if he only had a little brandy to take along with\r\nhim, to soothe his paroxyms of pain when they came on, he would be\r\ngrateful and content.  He was quickly supplied with two bottles, and we\r\ndrove off.  He was so smiling and happy after that, that I could not\r\nrefrain from asking him how he could possibly be so comfortable with a\r\ncrushed foot.\r\n\r\n"Well," said he, "I hadn\'t had a drink for twelve hours, and hadn\'t a\r\ncent to my name.  I was most perishing--and so, when that duffer dropped\r\nthat hundred-pounder on my foot, I see my chance.  Got a cork leg, you\r\nknow!" and he pulled up his pantaloons and proved it.\r\n\r\nHe was as drunk as a lord all day long, and full of chucklings over his\r\ntimely ingenuity.\r\n\r\nOne drunken man necessarily reminds one of another.  I once heard a\r\ngentleman tell about an incident which he witnessed in a Californian\r\nbar-room.  He entitled it "Ye Modest Man Taketh a Drink."  It was nothing\r\nbut a bit of acting, but it seemed to me a perfect rendering, and worthy\r\nof Toodles himself.  The modest man, tolerably far gone with beer and\r\nother matters, enters a saloon (twenty-five cents is the price for\r\nanything and everything, and specie the only money used) and lays down a\r\nhalf dollar; calls for whiskey and drinks it; the bar-keeper makes change\r\nand lays the quarter in a wet place on the counter; the modest man\r\nfumbles at it with nerveless fingers, but it slips and the water holds\r\nit; he contemplates it, and tries again; same result; observes that\r\npeople are interested in what he is at, blushes; fumbles at the quarter\r\nagain--blushes--puts his forefinger carefully, slowly down, to make sure\r\nof his aim--pushes the coin toward the bar-keeper, and says with a sigh:\r\n\r\n"Gimme a cigar!"\r\n\r\nNaturally, another gentleman present told about another drunken man.  He\r\nsaid he reeled toward home late at night; made a mistake and entered the\r\nwrong gate; thought he saw a dog on the stoop; and it was--an iron one.\r\n\r\nHe stopped and considered; wondered if it was a dangerous dog; ventured\r\nto say "Be (hic) begone!"  No effect.  Then he approached warily, and\r\nadopted conciliation; pursed up his lips and tried to whistle, but\r\nfailed; still approached, saying, "Poor dog!--doggy, doggy, doggy!--poor\r\ndoggy-dog!"  Got up on the stoop, still petting with fond names; till\r\nmaster of the advantages; then exclaimed, "Leave, you thief!"--planted a\r\nvindictive kick in his ribs, and went head-over-heels overboard, of\r\ncourse.  A pause; a sigh or two of pain, and then a remark in a\r\nreflective voice:\r\n\r\n"Awful solid dog.  What could he ben eating?  (\'ic!) Rocks, p\'raps.\r\nSuch animals is dangerous.--\'  At\'s what I say--they\'re dangerous.  If a\r\nman--(\'ic!)--if a man wants to feed a dog on rocks, let him feed him on\r\nrocks; \'at\'s all right; but let him keep him at home--not have him layin\'\r\nround promiscuous, where (\'ic!) where people\'s liable to stumble over him\r\nwhen they ain\'t noticin\'!"\r\n\r\nIt was not without regret that I took a last look at the tiny flag (it\r\nwas thirty-five feet long and ten feet wide) fluttering like a lady\'s\r\nhandkerchief from the topmost peak of Mount Davidson, two thousand feet\r\nabove Virginia\'s roofs, and felt that doubtless I was bidding a permanent\r\nfarewell to a city which had afforded me the most vigorous enjoyment of\r\nlife I had ever experienced.  And this reminds me of an incident which\r\nthe dullest memory Virginia could boast at the time it happened must\r\nvividly recall, at times, till its possessor dies.  Late one summer\r\nafternoon we had a rain shower.\r\n\r\nThat was astonishing enough, in itself, to set the whole town buzzing,\r\nfor it only rains (during a week or two weeks) in the winter in Nevada,\r\nand even then not enough at a time to make it worth while for any\r\nmerchant to keep umbrellas for sale.  But the rain was not the chief\r\nwonder.  It only lasted five or ten minutes; while the people were still\r\ntalking about it all the heavens gathered to themselves a dense blackness\r\nas of midnight.  All the vast eastern front of Mount Davidson,\r\nover-looking the city, put on such a funereal gloom that only the\r\nnearness and solidity of the mountain made its outlines even faintly\r\ndistinguishable from the dead blackness of the heavens they rested\r\nagainst.  This unaccustomed sight turned all eyes toward the mountain;\r\nand as they looked, a little tongue of rich golden flame was seen waving\r\nand quivering in the heart of the midnight, away up on the extreme\r\nsummit! In a few minutes the streets were packed with people, gazing with\r\nhardly an uttered word, at the one brilliant mote in the brooding world\r\nof darkness.  It flicked like a candle-flame, and looked no larger; but\r\nwith such a background it was wonderfully bright, small as it was.  It\r\nwas the flag!--though no one suspected it at first, it seemed so like a\r\nsupernatural visitor of some kind--a mysterious messenger of good\r\ntidings, some were fain to believe.  It was the nation\'s emblem\r\ntransfigured by the departing rays of a sun that was entirely palled from\r\nview; and on no other object did the glory fall, in all the broad\r\npanorama of mountain ranges and deserts.  Not even upon the staff of the\r\nflag--for that, a needle in the distance at any time, was now untouched\r\nby the light and undistinguishable in the gloom.  For a whole hour the\r\nweird visitor winked and burned in its lofty solitude, and still the\r\nthousands of uplifted eyes watched it with fascinated interest.  How the\r\npeople were wrought up!  The superstition grew apace that this was a\r\nmystic courier come with great news from the war--the poetry of the idea\r\nexcusing and commending it--and on it spread, from heart to heart, from\r\nlip to lip and from street to street, till there was a general impulse to\r\nhave out the military and welcome the bright waif with a salvo of\r\nartillery!\r\n\r\nAnd all that time one sorely tried man, the telegraph operator sworn to\r\nofficial secrecy, had to lock his lips and chain his tongue with a\r\nsilence that was like to rend them; for he, and he only, of all the\r\nspeculating multitude, knew the great things this sinking sun had seen\r\nthat day in the east--Vicksburg fallen, and the Union arms victorious at\r\nGettysburg!\r\n\r\nBut for the journalistic monopoly that forbade the slightest revealment\r\nof eastern news till a day after its publication in the California\r\npapers, the glorified flag on Mount Davidson would have been saluted and\r\nre-saluted, that memorable evening, as long as there was a charge of\r\npowder to thunder with; the city would have been illuminated, and every\r\nman that had any respect for himself would have got drunk,--as was the\r\ncustom of the country on all occasions of public moment.  Even at this\r\ndistant day I cannot think of this needlessly marred supreme opportunity\r\nwithout regret.  What a time we might have had!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\nWe rumbled over the plains and valleys, climbed the Sierras to the\r\nclouds, and looked down upon summer-clad California.  And I will remark\r\nhere, in passing, that all scenery in California requires distance to\r\ngive it its highest charm.  The mountains are imposing in their sublimity\r\nand their majesty of form and altitude, from any point of view--but one\r\nmust have distance to soften their ruggedness and enrich their tintings;\r\na Californian forest is best at a little distance, for there is a sad\r\npoverty of variety in species, the trees being chiefly of one monotonous\r\nfamily--redwood, pine, spruce, fir--and so, at a near view there is a\r\nwearisome sameness of attitude in their rigid arms, stretched down ward\r\nand outward in one continued and reiterated appeal to all men to "Sh!\r\n--don\'t say a word!--you might disturb somebody!"  Close at hand, too,\r\nthere is a reliefless and relentless smell of pitch and turpentine; there\r\nis a ceaseless melancholy in their sighing and complaining foliage; one\r\nwalks over a soundless carpet of beaten yellow bark and dead spines of\r\nthe foliage till he feels like a wandering spirit bereft of a footfall;\r\nhe tires of the endless tufts of needles and yearns for substantial,\r\nshapely leaves; he looks for moss and grass to loll upon, and finds none,\r\nfor where there is no bark there is naked clay and dirt, enemies to\r\npensive musing and clean apparel.  Often a grassy plain in California, is\r\nwhat it should be, but often, too, it is best contemplated at a distance,\r\nbecause although its grass blades are tall, they stand up vindictively\r\nstraight and self-sufficient, and are unsociably wide apart, with\r\nuncomely spots of barren sand between.\r\n\r\nOne of the queerest things I know of, is to hear tourists from "the\r\nStates" go into ecstasies over the loveliness of "ever-blooming\r\nCalifornia."  And they always do go into that sort of ecstasies.  But\r\nperhaps they would modify them if they knew how old Californians, with\r\nthe memory full upon them of the dust-covered and questionable summer\r\ngreens of Californian "verdure," stand astonished, and filled with\r\nworshipping admiration, in the presence of the lavish richness, the\r\nbrilliant green, the infinite freshness, the spend-thrift variety of form\r\nand species and foliage that make an Eastern landscape a vision of\r\nParadise itself.  The idea of a man falling into raptures over grave and\r\nsombre California, when that man has seen New England\'s meadow-expanses\r\nand her maples, oaks and cathedral-windowed elms decked in summer attire,\r\nor the opaline splendors of autumn descending upon her forests, comes\r\nvery near being funny--would be, in fact, but that it is so pathetic.\r\nNo land with an unvarying climate can be very beautiful.  The tropics are\r\nnot, for all the sentiment that is wasted on them.  They seem beautiful\r\nat first, but sameness impairs the charm by and by.  Change is the\r\nhandmaiden Nature requires to do her miracles with.  The land that has\r\nfour well-defined seasons, cannot lack beauty, or pall with monotony.\r\nEach season brings a world of enjoyment and interest in the watching of\r\nits unfolding, its gradual, harmonious development, its culminating\r\ngraces--and just as one begins to tire of it, it passes away and a\r\nradical change comes, with new witcheries and new glories in its train.\r\nAnd I think that to one in sympathy with nature, each season, in its\r\nturn, seems the loveliest.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco, a truly fascinating city to live in, is stately and\r\nhandsome at a fair distance, but close at hand one notes that the\r\narchitecture is mostly old-fashioned, many streets are made up of\r\ndecaying, smoke-grimed, wooden houses, and the barren sand-hills toward\r\nthe outskirts obtrude themselves too prominently.  Even the kindly\r\nclimate is sometimes pleasanter when read about than personally\r\nexperienced, for a lovely, cloudless sky wears out its welcome by and by,\r\nand then when the longed for rain does come it stays.  Even the playful\r\nearthquake is better contemplated at a dis----\r\n\r\nHowever there are varying opinions about that.\r\n\r\nThe climate of San Francisco is mild and singularly equable.  The\r\nthermometer stands at about seventy degrees the year round.  It hardly\r\nchanges at all.  You sleep under one or two light blankets Summer and\r\nWinter, and never use a mosquito bar.  Nobody ever wears Summer clothing.\r\nYou wear black broadcloth--if you have it--in August and January, just\r\nthe same.  It is no colder, and no warmer, in the one month than the\r\nother.  You do not use overcoats and you do not use fans.  It is as\r\npleasant a climate as could well be contrived, take it all around, and is\r\ndoubtless the most unvarying in the whole world.  The wind blows there a\r\ngood deal in the summer months, but then you can go over to Oakland, if\r\nyou choose--three or four miles away--it does not blow there.  It has\r\nonly snowed twice in San Francisco in nineteen years, and then it only\r\nremained on the ground long enough to astonish the children, and set them\r\nto wondering what the feathery stuff was.\r\n\r\nDuring eight months of the year, straight along, the skies are bright and\r\ncloudless, and never a drop of rain falls.  But when the other four\r\nmonths come along, you will need to go and steal an umbrella.  Because\r\nyou will require it.  Not just one day, but one hundred and twenty days\r\nin hardly varying succession.  When you want to go visiting, or attend\r\nchurch, or the theatre, you never look up at the clouds to see whether it\r\nis likely to rain or not--you look at the almanac.  If it is Winter, it\r\nwill rain--and if it is Summer, it won\'t rain, and you cannot help it.\r\nYou never need a lightning-rod, because it never thunders and it never\r\nlightens.  And after you have listened for six or eight weeks, every\r\nnight, to the dismal monotony of those quiet rains, you will wish in your\r\nheart the thunder would leap and crash and roar along those drowsy skies\r\nonce, and make everything alive--you will wish the prisoned lightnings\r\nwould cleave the dull firmament asunder and light it with a blinding\r\nglare for one little instant.  You would give anything to hear the old\r\nfamiliar thunder again and see the lightning strike somebody.  And along\r\nin the Summer, when you have suffered about four months of lustrous,\r\npitiless sunshine, you are ready to go down on your knees and plead for\r\nrain--hail--snow--thunder and lightning--anything to break the monotony\r\n--you will take an earthquake, if you cannot do any better.  And the\r\nchances are that you\'ll get it, too.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco is built on sand hills, but they are prolific sand hills.\r\nThey yield a generous vegetation.  All the rare flowers which people in\r\n"the States" rear with such patient care in parlor flower-pots and\r\ngreen-houses, flourish luxuriantly in the open air there all the year\r\nround. Calla lilies, all sorts of geraniums, passion flowers, moss\r\nroses--I do not know the names of a tenth part of them.  I only know that\r\nwhile New Yorkers are burdened with banks and drifts of snow,\r\nCalifornians are burdened with banks and drifts of flowers, if they only\r\nkeep their hands off and let them grow.  And I have heard that they have\r\nalso that rarest and most curious of all the flowers, the beautiful\r\nEspiritu Santo, as the Spaniards call it--or flower of the Holy Spirit\r\n--though I thought it grew only in Central America--down on the Isthmus.\r\nIn its cup is the daintiest little facsimile of a dove, as pure as snow.\r\nThe Spaniards have a superstitious reverence for it.  The blossom has\r\nbeen conveyed to the States, submerged in ether; and the bulb has been\r\ntaken thither also, but every attempt to make it bloom after it arrived,\r\nhas failed.\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere spoken of the endless Winter of Mono, California, and\r\nbut this moment of the eternal Spring of San Francisco.  Now if we travel\r\na hundred miles in a straight line, we come to the eternal Summer of\r\nSacramento.  One never sees Summer-clothing or mosquitoes in San\r\nFrancisco--but they can be found in Sacramento.  Not always and\r\nunvaryingly, but about one hundred and forty-three months out of twelve\r\nyears, perhaps.  Flowers bloom there, always, the reader can easily\r\nbelieve--people suffer and sweat, and swear, morning, noon and night, and\r\nwear out their stanchest energies fanning themselves.  It gets hot there,\r\nbut if you go down to Fort Yuma you will find it hotter.  Fort Yuma is\r\nprobably the hottest place on earth.  The thermometer stays at one\r\nhundred and twenty in the shade there all the time--except when it varies\r\nand goes higher.  It is a U.S. military post, and its occupants get so\r\nused to the terrific heat that they suffer without it.  There is a\r\ntradition (attributed to John Phenix [It has been purloined by fifty\r\ndifferent scribblers who were too poor to invent a fancy but not ashamed\r\nto steal one.--M.  T.]) that a very, very wicked soldier died there,\r\nonce, and of course, went straight to the hottest corner of perdition,\r\n--and the next day he telegraphed back for his blankets.  There is no doubt\r\nabout the truth of this statement--there can be no doubt about it.  I\r\nhave seen the place where that soldier used to board.  In Sacramento it\r\nis fiery Summer always, and you can gather roses, and eat strawberries\r\nand ice-cream, and wear white linen clothes, and pant and perspire, at\r\neight or nine o\'clock in the morning, and then take the cars, and at noon\r\nput on your furs and your skates, and go skimming over frozen Donner\r\nLake, seven thousand feet above the valley, among snow banks fifteen feet\r\ndeep, and in the shadow of grand mountain peaks that lift their frosty\r\ncrags ten thousand feet above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nThere is a transition for you!  Where will you find another like it in\r\nthe Western hemisphere?  And some of us have swept around snow-walled\r\ncurves of the Pacific Railroad in that vicinity, six thousand feet above\r\nthe sea, and looked down as the birds do, upon the deathless Summer of\r\nthe Sacramento Valley, with its fruitful fields, its feathery foliage,\r\nits silver streams, all slumbering in the mellow haze of its enchanted\r\natmosphere, and all infinitely softened and spiritualized by distance--a\r\ndreamy, exquisite glimpse of fairyland, made all the more charming and\r\nstriking that it was caught through a forbidden gateway of ice and snow,\r\nand savage crags and precipices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\nIt was in this Sacramento Valley, just referred to, that a deal of the\r\nmost lucrative of the early gold mining was done, and you may still see,\r\nin places, its grassy slopes and levels torn and guttered and disfigured\r\nby the avaricious spoilers of fifteen and twenty years ago.  You may see\r\nsuch disfigurements far and wide over California--and in some such\r\nplaces, where only meadows and forests are visible--not a living\r\ncreature, not a house, no stick or stone or remnant of a ruin, and not a\r\nsound, not even a whisper to disturb the Sabbath stillness--you will find\r\nit hard to believe that there stood at one time a fiercely-flourishing\r\nlittle city, of two thousand or three thousand souls, with its newspaper,\r\nfire company, brass band, volunteer militia, bank, hotels, noisy Fourth\r\nof July processions and speeches, gambling hells crammed with tobacco\r\nsmoke, profanity, and rough-bearded men of all nations and colors, with\r\ntables heaped with gold dust sufficient for the revenues of a German\r\nprincipality--streets crowded and rife with business--town lots worth\r\nfour hundred dollars a front foot--labor, laughter, music, dancing,\r\nswearing, fighting, shooting, stabbing--a bloody inquest and a man for\r\nbreakfast every morning--everything that delights and adorns existence\r\n--all the appointments and appurtenances of a thriving and prosperous and\r\npromising young city,--and now nothing is left of it all but a lifeless,\r\nhomeless solitude.  The men are gone, the houses have vanished, even the\r\nname of the place is forgotten.  In no other land, in modern times, have\r\ntowns so absolutely died and disappeared, as in the old mining regions of\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nIt was a driving, vigorous, restless population in those days.  It was a\r\ncurious population.  It was the only population of the kind that the\r\nworld has ever seen gathered together, and it is not likely that the\r\nworld will ever see its like again.  For observe, it was an assemblage of\r\ntwo hundred thousand young men--not simpering, dainty, kid-gloved\r\nweaklings, but stalwart, muscular, dauntless young braves, brimful of\r\npush and energy, and royally endowed with every attribute that goes to\r\nmake up a peerless and magnificent manhood--the very pick and choice of\r\nthe world\'s glorious ones.  No women, no children, no gray and stooping\r\nveterans,--none but erect, bright-eyed, quick-moving, strong-handed young\r\ngiants--the strangest population, the finest population, the most gallant\r\nhost that ever trooped down the startled solitudes of an unpeopled land.\r\nAnd where are they now?  Scattered to the ends of the earth--or\r\nprematurely aged and decrepit--or shot or stabbed in street affrays--or\r\ndead of disappointed hopes and broken hearts--all gone, or nearly all\r\n--victims devoted upon the altar of the golden calf--the noblest holocaust\r\nthat ever wafted its sacrificial incense heavenward.  It is pitiful to\r\nthink upon.\r\n\r\nIt was a splendid population--for all the slow, sleepy, sluggish-brained\r\nsloths staid at home--you never find that sort of people among pioneers\r\n--you cannot build pioneers out of that sort of material.  It was that\r\npopulation that gave to California a name for getting up astounding\r\nenterprises and rushing them through with a magnificent dash and daring\r\nand a recklessness of cost or consequences, which she bears unto this\r\nday--and when she projects a new surprise, the grave world smiles as\r\nusual, and says "Well, that is California all over."\r\n\r\nBut they were rough in those times!  They fairly reveled in gold, whisky,\r\nfights, and fandangoes, and were unspeakably happy.  The honest miner\r\nraked from a hundred to a thousand dollars out of his claim a day, and\r\nwhat with the gambling dens and the other entertainments, he hadn\'t a\r\ncent the next morning, if he had any sort of luck.  They cooked their own\r\nbacon and beans, sewed on their own buttons, washed their own shirts\r\n--blue woollen ones; and if a man wanted a fight on his hands without any\r\nannoying delay, all he had to do was to appear in public in a white shirt\r\nor a stove-pipe hat, and he would be accommodated.  For those people\r\nhated aristocrats.  They had a particular and malignant animosity toward\r\nwhat they called a "biled shirt."\r\n\r\nIt was a wild, free, disorderly, grotesque society!  Men--only swarming\r\nhosts of stalwart men--nothing juvenile, nothing feminine, visible\r\nanywhere!\r\n\r\nIn those days miners would flock in crowds to catch a glimpse of that\r\nrare and blessed spectacle, a woman!  Old inhabitants tell how, in a\r\ncertain camp, the news went abroad early in the morning that a woman was\r\ncome!  They had seen a calico dress hanging out of a wagon down at the\r\ncamping-ground--sign of emigrants from over the great plains.  Everybody\r\nwent down there, and a shout went up when an actual, bona fide dress was\r\ndiscovered fluttering in the wind!  The male emigrant was visible.  The\r\nminers said:\r\n\r\n"Fetch her out!"\r\n\r\nHe said: "It is my wife, gentlemen--she is sick--we have been robbed of\r\nmoney, provisions, everything, by the Indians--we want to rest."\r\n\r\n"Fetch her out!  We\'ve got to see her!"\r\n\r\n"But, gentlemen, the poor thing, she--"\r\n\r\n"FETCH HER OUT!"\r\n\r\nHe "fetched her out," and they swung their hats and sent up three rousing\r\ncheers and a tiger; and they crowded around and gazed at her, and touched\r\nher dress, and listened to her voice with the look of men who listened to\r\na memory rather than a present reality--and then they collected\r\ntwenty-five hundred dollars in gold and gave it to the man, and swung\r\ntheir hats again and gave three more cheers, and went home satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce I dined in San Francisco with the family of a pioneer, and talked\r\nwith his daughter, a young lady whose first experience in San Francisco\r\nwas an adventure, though she herself did not remember it, as she was only\r\ntwo or three years old at the time.  Her father said that, after landing\r\nfrom the ship, they were walking up the street, a servant leading the\r\nparty with the little girl in her arms.  And presently a huge miner,\r\nbearded, belted, spurred, and bristling with deadly weapons--just down\r\nfrom a long campaign in the mountains, evidently-barred the way, stopped\r\nthe servant, and stood gazing, with a face all alive with gratification\r\nand astonishment.  Then he said, reverently:\r\n\r\n"Well, if it ain\'t a child!" And then he snatched a little leather sack\r\nout of his pocket and said to the servant:\r\n\r\n"There\'s a hundred and fifty dollars in dust, there, and I\'ll give it to\r\nyou to let me kiss the child!"\r\n\r\nThat anecdote is true.\r\n\r\nBut see how things change.  Sitting at that dinner-table, listening to\r\nthat anecdote, if I had offered double the money for the privilege of\r\nkissing the same child, I would have been refused.  Seventeen added years\r\nhave far more than doubled the price.\r\n\r\nAnd while upon this subject I will remark that once in Star City, in the\r\nHumboldt Mountains, I took my place in a sort of long, post-office single\r\nfile of miners, to patiently await my chance to peep through a crack in\r\nthe cabin and get a sight of the splendid new sensation--a genuine, live\r\nWoman!  And at the end of half of an hour my turn came, and I put my eye\r\nto the crack, and there she was, with one arm akimbo, and tossing\r\nflap-jacks in a frying-pan with the other.\r\n\r\nAnd she was one hundred and sixty-five [Being in calmer mood, now, I\r\nvoluntarily knock off a hundred from that.--M.T.] years old, and hadn\'t a\r\ntooth in her head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\nFor a few months I enjoyed what to me was an entirely new phase of\r\nexistence--a butterfly idleness; nothing to do, nobody to be responsible\r\nto, and untroubled with financial uneasiness.  I fell in love with the\r\nmost cordial and sociable city in the Union.  After the sage-brush and\r\nalkali deserts of Washoe, San Francisco was Paradise to me.  I lived at\r\nthe best hotel, exhibited my clothes in the most conspicuous places,\r\ninfested the opera, and learned to seem enraptured with music which\r\noftener afflicted my ignorant ear than enchanted it, if I had had the\r\nvulgar honesty to confess it.  However, I suppose I was not greatly worse\r\nthan the most of my countrymen in that.  I had longed to be a butterfly,\r\nand I was one at last.  I attended private parties in sumptuous evening\r\ndress, simpered and aired my graces like a born beau, and polkad and\r\nschottisched with a step peculiar to myself--and the kangaroo.  In a\r\nword, I kept the due state of a man worth a hundred thousand dollars\r\n(prospectively,) and likely to reach absolute affluence when that\r\nsilver-mine sale should be ultimately achieved in the East.  I spent\r\nmoney with a free hand, and meantime watched the stock sales with an\r\ninterested eye and looked to see what might happen in Nevada.\r\n\r\nSomething very important happened.  The property holders of Nevada voted\r\nagainst the State Constitution; but the folks who had nothing to lose\r\nwere in the majority, and carried the measure over their heads.  But\r\nafter all it did not immediately look like a disaster, though\r\nunquestionably it was one I hesitated, calculated the chances, and then\r\nconcluded not to sell.  Stocks went on rising; speculation went mad;\r\nbankers, merchants, lawyers, doctors, mechanics, laborers, even the very\r\nwasherwomen and servant girls, were putting up their earnings on silver\r\nstocks, and every sun that rose in the morning went down on paupers\r\nenriched and rich men beggared.  What a gambling carnival it was!  Gould\r\nand Curry soared to six thousand three hundred dollars a foot!  And then\r\n--all of a sudden, out went the bottom and everything and everybody went\r\nto ruin and destruction!  The wreck was complete.\r\n\r\nThe bubble scarcely left a microscopic moisture behind it.  I was an\r\nearly beggar and a thorough one.  My hoarded stocks were not worth the\r\npaper they were printed on.  I threw them all away.  I, the cheerful\r\nidiot that had been squandering money like water, and thought myself\r\nbeyond the reach of misfortune, had not now as much as fifty dollars when\r\nI gathered together my various debts and paid them.  I removed from the\r\nhotel to a very private boarding house.  I took a reporter\'s berth and\r\nwent to work.  I was not entirely broken in spirit, for I was building\r\nconfidently on the sale of the silver mine in the east.  But I could not\r\nhear from Dan.  My letters miscarried or were not answered.\r\n\r\nOne day I did not feel vigorous and remained away from the office.  The\r\nnext day I went down toward noon as usual, and found a note on my desk\r\nwhich had been there twenty-four hours.  It was signed "Marshall"--the\r\nVirginia reporter--and contained a request that I should call at the\r\nhotel and see him and a friend or two that night, as they would sail for\r\nthe east in the morning.  A postscript added that their errand was a big\r\nmining speculation!  I was hardly ever so sick in my life.  I abused\r\nmyself for leaving Virginia and entrusting to another man a matter I\r\nought to have attended to myself; I abused myself for remaining away from\r\nthe office on the one day of all the year that I should have been there.\r\nAnd thus berating myself I trotted a mile to the steamer wharf and\r\narrived just in time to be too late.  The ship was in the stream and\r\nunder way.\r\n\r\nI comforted myself with the thought that may be the speculation would\r\namount to nothing--poor comfort at best--and then went back to my\r\nslavery, resolved to put up with my thirty-five dollars a week and forget\r\nall about it.\r\n\r\nA month afterward I enjoyed my first earthquake.  It was one which was\r\nlong called the "great" earthquake, and is doubtless so distinguished\r\ntill this day.  It was just after noon, on a bright October day.  I was\r\ncoming down Third street.  The only objects in motion anywhere in sight\r\nin that thickly built and populous quarter, were a man in a buggy behind\r\nme, and a street car wending slowly up the cross street.  Otherwise, all\r\nwas solitude and a Sabbath stillness.  As I turned the corner, around a\r\nframe house, there was a great rattle and jar, and it occurred to me that\r\nhere was an item!--no doubt a fight in that house.  Before I could turn\r\nand seek the door, there came a really terrific shock; the ground seemed\r\nto roll under me in waves, interrupted by a violent joggling up and down,\r\nand there was a heavy grinding noise as of brick houses rubbing together.\r\nI fell up against the frame house and hurt my elbow.  I knew what it was,\r\nnow, and from mere reportorial instinct, nothing else, took out my watch\r\nand noted the time of day; at that moment a third and still severer shock\r\ncame, and as I reeled about on the pavement trying to keep my footing,\r\nI saw a sight!  The entire front of a tall four-story brick building in\r\nThird street sprung outward like a door and fell sprawling across the\r\nstreet, raising a dust like a great volume of smoke!  And here came the\r\nbuggy--overboard went the man, and in less time than I can tell it the\r\nvehicle was distributed in small fragments along three hundred yards of\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nOne could have fancied that somebody had fired a charge of chair-rounds\r\nand rags down the thoroughfare.  The street car had stopped, the horses\r\nwere rearing and plunging, the passengers were pouring out at both ends,\r\nand one fat man had crashed half way through a glass window on one side\r\nof the car, got wedged fast and was squirming and screaming like an\r\nimpaled madman.  Every door, of every house, as far as the eye could\r\nreach, was vomiting a stream of human beings; and almost before one could\r\nexecute a wink and begin another, there was a massed multitude of people\r\nstretching in endless procession down every street my position commanded.\r\nNever was solemn solitude turned into teeming life quicker.\r\n\r\nOf the wonders wrought by "the great earthquake," these were all that\r\ncame under my eye; but the tricks it did, elsewhere, and far and wide\r\nover the town, made toothsome gossip for nine days.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of property was trifling--the injury to it was\r\nwide-spread and somewhat serious.\r\n\r\nThe "curiosities" of the earthquake were simply endless.  Gentlemen and\r\nladies who were sick, or were taking a siesta, or had dissipated till a\r\nlate hour and were making up lost sleep, thronged into the public streets\r\nin all sorts of queer apparel, and some without any at all.  One woman\r\nwho had been washing a naked child, ran down the street holding it by the\r\nankles as if it were a dressed turkey.  Prominent citizens who were\r\nsupposed to keep the Sabbath strictly, rushed out of saloons in their\r\nshirt-sleeves, with billiard cues in their hands.  Dozens of men with\r\nnecks swathed in napkins, rushed from barber-shops, lathered to the eyes\r\nor with one cheek clean shaved and the other still bearing a hairy\r\nstubble.  Horses broke from stables, and a frightened dog rushed up a\r\nshort attic ladder and out on to a roof, and when his scare was over had\r\nnot the nerve to go down again the same way he had gone up.\r\n\r\nA prominent editor flew down stairs, in the principal hotel, with nothing\r\non but one brief undergarment--met a chambermaid, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Oh, what shall I do!  Where shall I go!"\r\n\r\nShe responded with naive serenity:\r\n\r\n"If you have no choice, you might try a clothing-store!"\r\n\r\nA certain foreign consul\'s lady was the acknowledged leader of fashion,\r\nand every time she appeared in anything new or extraordinary, the ladies\r\nin the vicinity made a raid on their husbands\' purses and arrayed\r\nthemselves similarly.  One man who had suffered considerably and growled\r\naccordingly, was standing at the window when the shocks came, and the\r\nnext instant the consul\'s wife, just out of the bath, fled by with no\r\nother apology for clothing than--a bath-towel!  The sufferer rose\r\nsuperior to the terrors of the earthquake, and said to his wife:\r\n\r\n"Now that is something like!  Get out your towel my dear!"\r\n\r\nThe plastering that fell from ceilings in San Francisco that day, would\r\nhave covered several acres of ground.  For some days afterward, groups of\r\neyeing and pointing men stood about many a building, looking at long\r\nzig-zag cracks that extended from the eaves to the ground.  Four feet of\r\nthe tops of three chimneys on one house were broken square off and turned\r\naround in such a way as to completely stop the draft.\r\n\r\nA crack a hundred feet long gaped open six inches wide in the middle of\r\none street and then shut together again with such force, as to ridge up\r\nthe meeting earth like a slender grave.  A lady sitting in her rocking\r\nand quaking parlor, saw the wall part at the ceiling, open and shut\r\ntwice, like a mouth, and then-drop the end of a brick on the floor like a\r\ntooth.  She was a woman easily disgusted with foolishness, and she arose\r\nand went out of there.  One lady who was coming down stairs was\r\nastonished to see a bronze Hercules lean forward on its pedestal as if to\r\nstrike her with its club.  They both reached the bottom of the flight at\r\nthe same time,--the woman insensible from the fright.  Her child, born\r\nsome little time afterward, was club-footed.  However--on second\r\nthought,--if the reader sees any coincidence in this, he must do it at\r\nhis own risk.\r\n\r\nThe first shock brought down two or three huge organ-pipes in one of the\r\nchurches.  The minister, with uplifted hands, was just closing the\r\nservices.  He glanced up, hesitated, and said:\r\n\r\n"However, we will omit the benediction!"--and the next instant there was\r\na vacancy in the atmosphere where he had stood.\r\n\r\nAfter the first shock, an Oakland minister said:\r\n\r\n"Keep your seats!  There is no better place to die than this"--\r\n\r\nAnd added, after the third:\r\n\r\n"But outside is good enough!"  He then skipped out at the back door.\r\n\r\nSuch another destruction of mantel ornaments and toilet bottles as the\r\nearthquake created, San Francisco never saw before.  There was hardly a\r\ngirl or a matron in the city but suffered losses of this kind.  Suspended\r\npictures were thrown down, but oftener still, by a curious freak of the\r\nearthquake\'s humor, they were whirled completely around with their faces\r\nto the wall!  There was great difference of opinion, at first, as to the\r\ncourse or direction the earthquake traveled, but water that splashed out\r\nof various tanks and buckets settled that.  Thousands of people were made\r\nso sea-sick by the rolling and pitching of floors and streets that they\r\nwere weak and bed-ridden for hours, and some few for even days\r\nafterward.--Hardly an individual escaped nausea entirely.\r\n\r\nThe queer earthquake--episodes that formed the staple of San Francisco\r\ngossip for the next week would fill a much larger book than this, and so\r\nI will diverge from the subject.\r\n\r\nBy and by, in the due course of things, I picked up a copy of the\r\nEnterprise one day, and fell under this cruel blow:\r\n\r\n      NEVADA MINES IN NEW YORK.--G.  M.  Marshall, Sheba Hurs and Amos H.\r\n      Rose, who left San Francisco last July for New York City, with ores\r\n      from mines in Pine Wood District, Humboldt County, and on the Reese\r\n      River range, have disposed of a mine containing six thousand feet\r\n      and called the Pine Mountains Consolidated, for the sum of\r\n      $3,000,000.  The stamps on the deed, which is now on its way to\r\n      Humboldt County, from New York, for record, amounted to $3,000,\r\n      which is said to be the largest amount of stamps ever placed on one\r\n      document.  A working capital of $1,000,000 has been paid into the\r\n      treasury, and machinery has already been purchased for a large\r\n      quartz mill, which will be put up as soon as possible.  The stock in\r\n      this company is all full paid and entirely unassessable.  The ores\r\n      of the mines in this district somewhat resemble those of the Sheba\r\n      mine in Humboldt.  Sheba Hurst, the discoverer of the mines, with\r\n      his friends corralled all the best leads and all the land and timber\r\n      they desired before making public their whereabouts.  Ores from\r\n      there, assayed in this city, showed them to be exceedingly rich in\r\n      silver and gold--silver predominating.  There is an abundance of\r\n      wood and water in the District.  We are glad to know that New York\r\n      capital has been enlisted in the development of the mines of this\r\n      region.  Having seen the ores and assays, we are satisfied that the\r\n      mines of the District are very valuable--anything but wild-cat.\r\n\r\nOnce more native imbecility had carried the day, and I had lost a\r\nmillion!  It was the "blind lead" over again.\r\n\r\nLet us not dwell on this miserable matter.  If I were inventing these\r\nthings, I could be wonderfully humorous over them; but they are too true\r\nto be talked of with hearty levity, even at this distant day. [True, and\r\nyet not exactly as given in the above figures, possibly.  I saw Marshall,\r\nmonths afterward, and although he had plenty of money he did not claim to\r\nhave captured an entire million.  In fact I gathered that he had not then\r\nreceived $50,000.  Beyond that figure his fortune appeared to consist of\r\nuncertain vast expectations rather than prodigious certainties.  However,\r\nwhen the above item appeared in print I put full faith in it, and\r\nincontinently wilted and went to seed under it.] Suffice it that I so\r\nlost heart, and so yielded myself up to repinings and sighings and\r\nfoolish regrets, that I neglected my duties and became about worthless,\r\nas a reporter for a brisk newspaper.  And at last one of the proprietors\r\ntook me aside, with a charity I still remember with considerable respect,\r\nand gave me an opportunity to resign my berth and so save myself the\r\ndisgrace of a dismissal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\nFor a time I wrote literary screeds for the Golden Era. C. H. Webb had\r\nestablished a very excellent literary weekly called the Californian, but\r\nhigh merit was no guaranty of success; it languished, and he sold out to\r\nthree printers, and Bret Harte became editor at $20 a week, and I was\r\nemployed to contribute an article a week at $12.  But the journal still\r\nlanguished, and the printers sold out to Captain Ogden, a rich man and a\r\npleasant gentleman who chose to amuse himself with such an expensive\r\nluxury without much caring about the cost of it.  When he grew tired of\r\nthe novelty, he re-sold to the printers, the paper presently died a\r\npeaceful death, and I was out of work again.  I would not mention these\r\nthings but for the fact that they so aptly illustrate the ups and downs\r\nthat characterize life on the Pacific coast.  A man could hardly stumble\r\ninto such a variety of queer vicissitudes in any other country.\r\n\r\nFor two months my sole occupation was avoiding acquaintances; for during\r\nthat time I did not earn a penny, or buy an article of any kind, or pay\r\nmy board.  I became a very adept at "slinking."  I slunk from back street\r\nto back street, I slunk away from approaching faces that looked familiar,\r\nI slunk to my meals, ate them humbly and with a mute apology for every\r\nmouthful I robbed my generous landlady of, and at midnight, after\r\nwanderings that were but slinkings away from cheerfulness and light, I\r\nslunk to my bed.  I felt meaner, and lowlier and more despicable than the\r\nworms.  During all this time I had but one piece of money--a silver ten\r\ncent piece--and I held to it and would not spend it on any account, lest\r\nthe consciousness coming strong upon me that I was entirely penniless,\r\nmight suggest suicide.  I had pawned every thing but the clothes I had\r\non; so I clung to my dime desperately, till it was smooth with handling.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am forgetting.  I did have one other occupation beside that of\r\n"slinking."  It was the entertaining of a collector (and being\r\nentertained by him,) who had in his hands the Virginia banker\'s bill for\r\nforty-six dollars which I had loaned my schoolmate, the "Prodigal."  This\r\nman used to call regularly once a week and dun me, and sometimes oftener.\r\nHe did it from sheer force of habit, for he knew he could get nothing.\r\nHe would get out his bill, calculate the interest for me, at five per\r\ncent a month, and show me clearly that there was no attempt at fraud in\r\nit and no mistakes; and then plead, and argue and dun with all his might\r\nfor any sum--any little trifle--even a dollar--even half a dollar, on\r\naccount.  Then his duty was accomplished and his conscience free.  He\r\nimmediately dropped the subject there always; got out a couple of cigars\r\nand divided, put his feet in the window, and then we would have a long,\r\nluxurious talk about everything and everybody, and he would furnish me a\r\nworld of curious dunning adventures out of the ample store in his memory.\r\nBy and by he would clap his hat on his head, shake hands and say briskly:\r\n\r\n"Well, business is business--can\'t stay with you always!"--and was off in\r\na second.\r\n\r\nThe idea of pining for a dun!  And yet I used to long for him to come,\r\nand would get as uneasy as any mother if the day went by without his\r\nvisit, when I was expecting him.  But he never collected that bill, at\r\nlast nor any part of it.  I lived to pay it to the banker myself.\r\n\r\nMisery loves company.  Now and then at night, in out-of-the way, dimly\r\nlighted places, I found myself happening on another child of misfortune.\r\nHe looked so seedy and forlorn, so homeless and friendless and forsaken,\r\nthat I yearned toward him as a brother.  I wanted to claim kinship with\r\nhim and go about and enjoy our wretchedness together.  The drawing toward\r\neach other must have been mutual; at any rate we got to falling together\r\noftener, though still seemingly by accident; and although we did not\r\nspeak or evince any recognition, I think the dull anxiety passed out of\r\nboth of us when we saw each other, and then for several hours we would\r\nidle along contentedly, wide apart, and glancing furtively in at home\r\nlights and fireside gatherings, out of the night shadows, and very much\r\nenjoying our dumb companionship.\r\n\r\nFinally we spoke, and were inseparable after that.  For our woes were\r\nidentical, almost.  He had been a reporter too, and lost his berth, and\r\nthis was his experience, as nearly as I can recollect it.  After losing\r\nhis berth he had gone down, down, down, with never a halt: from a\r\nboarding house on Russian Hill to a boarding house in Kearney street;\r\nfrom thence to Dupont; from thence to a low sailor den; and from thence\r\nto lodgings in goods boxes and empty hogsheads near the wharves.  Then;\r\nfor a while, he had gained a meagre living by sewing up bursted sacks of\r\ngrain on the piers; when that failed he had found food here and there as\r\nchance threw it in his way.  He had ceased to show his face in daylight,\r\nnow, for a reporter knows everybody, rich and poor, high and low, and\r\ncannot well avoid familiar faces in the broad light of day.\r\n\r\nThis mendicant Blucher--I call him that for convenience--was a splendid\r\ncreature.  He was full of hope, pluck and philosophy; he was well read\r\nand a man of cultivated taste; he had a bright wit and was a master of\r\nsatire; his kindliness and his generous spirit made him royal in my eyes\r\nand changed his curb-stone seat to a throne and his damaged hat to a\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\nHe had an adventure, once, which sticks fast in my memory as the most\r\npleasantly grotesque that ever touched my sympathies.  He had been\r\nwithout a penny for two months.  He had shirked about obscure streets,\r\namong friendly dim lights, till the thing had become second nature to\r\nhim.  But at last he was driven abroad in daylight.  The cause was\r\nsufficient; he had not tasted food for forty-eight hours, and he could\r\nnot endure the misery of his hunger in idle hiding.  He came along a back\r\nstreet, glowering at the loaves in bake-shop windows, and feeling that he\r\ncould trade his life away for a morsel to eat.  The sight of the bread\r\ndoubled his hunger; but it was good to look at it, any how, and imagine\r\nwhat one might do if one only had it.\r\n\r\nPresently, in the middle of the street he saw a shining spot--looked\r\nagain--did not, and could not, believe his eyes--turned away, to try\r\nthem, then looked again.  It was a verity--no vain, hunger-inspired\r\ndelusion--it was a silver dime!\r\n\r\nHe snatched it--gloated over it; doubted it--bit it--found it genuine\r\n--choked his heart down, and smothered a halleluiah.  Then he looked\r\naround--saw that nobody was looking at him--threw the dime down where it\r\nwas before--walked away a few steps, and approached again, pretending he\r\ndid not know it was there, so that he could re-enjoy the luxury of\r\nfinding it.  He walked around it, viewing it from different points; then\r\nsauntered about with his hands in his pockets, looking up at the signs\r\nand now and then glancing at it and feeling the old thrill again.\r\nFinally he took it up, and went away, fondling it in his pocket.  He\r\nidled through unfrequented streets, stopping in doorways and corners to\r\ntake it out and look at it.  By and by he went home to his lodgings--an\r\nempty queens-ware hogshead,--and employed himself till night trying to\r\nmake up his mind what to buy with it.  But it was hard to do.  To get the\r\nmost for it was the idea.  He knew that at the Miner\'s Restaurant he\r\ncould get a plate of beans and a piece of bread for ten cents; or a\r\nfish-ball and some few trifles, but they gave "no bread with one\r\nfish-ball" there.  At French Pete\'s he could get a veal cutlet, plain,\r\nand some radishes and bread, for ten cents; or a cup of coffee--a pint at\r\nleast--and a slice of bread; but the slice was not thick enough by the\r\neighth of an inch, and sometimes they were still more criminal than that\r\nin the cutting of it.  At seven o\'clock his hunger was wolfish; and still\r\nhis mind was not made up.  He turned out and went up Merchant street,\r\nstill ciphering; and chewing a bit of stick, as is the way of starving\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nHe passed before the lights of Martin\'s restaurant, the most aristocratic\r\nin the city, and stopped.  It was a place where he had often dined, in\r\nbetter days, and Martin knew him well.  Standing aside, just out of the\r\nrange of the light, he worshiped the quails and steaks in the show\r\nwindow, and imagined that may be the fairy times were not gone yet and\r\nsome prince in disguise would come along presently and tell him to go in\r\nthere and take whatever he wanted.  He chewed his stick with a hungry\r\ninterest as he warmed to his subject.  Just at this juncture he was\r\nconscious of some one at his side, sure enough; and then a finger touched\r\nhis arm.  He looked up, over his shoulder, and saw an apparition--a very\r\nallegory of Hunger!  It was a man six feet high, gaunt, unshaven, hung\r\nwith rags; with a haggard face and sunken cheeks, and eyes that pleaded\r\npiteously.  This phantom said:\r\n\r\n"Come with me--please."\r\n\r\nHe locked his arm in Blucher\'s and walked up the street to where the\r\npassengers were few and the light not strong, and then facing about, put\r\nout his hands in a beseeching way, and said:\r\n\r\n"Friend--stranger--look at me!  Life is easy to you--you go about, placid\r\nand content, as I did once, in my day--you have been in there, and eaten\r\nyour sumptuous supper, and picked your teeth, and hummed your tune, and\r\nthought your pleasant thoughts, and said to yourself it is a good world\r\n--but you\'ve never suffered!  You don\'t know what trouble is--you don\'t\r\nknow what misery is--nor hunger!  Look at me!  Stranger have pity on a\r\npoor friendless, homeless dog!  As God is my judge, I have not tasted\r\nfood for eight and forty hours!--look in my eyes and see if I lie!  Give\r\nme the least trifle in the world to keep me from starving--anything\r\n--twenty-five cents!  Do it, stranger--do it, please.  It will be nothing\r\nto you, but life to me.  Do it, and I will go down on my knees and lick\r\nthe dust before you!  I will kiss your footprints--I will worship the\r\nvery ground you walk on!  Only twenty-five cents!  I am famishing\r\n--perishing--starving by inches!  For God\'s sake don\'t desert me!"\r\n\r\nBlucher was bewildered--and touched, too--stirred to the depths.  He\r\nreflected.  Thought again.  Then an idea struck him, and he said:\r\n\r\n"Come with me."\r\n\r\nHe took the outcast\'s arm, walked him down to Martin\'s restaurant, seated\r\nhim at a marble table, placed the bill of fare before him, and said:\r\n\r\n"Order what you want, friend.  Charge it to me, Mr. Martin."\r\n\r\n"All right, Mr. Blucher," said Martin.\r\n\r\nThen Blucher stepped back and leaned against the counter and watched the\r\nman stow away cargo after cargo of buckwheat cakes at seventy-five cents\r\na plate; cup after cup of coffee, and porter house steaks worth two\r\ndollars apiece; and when six dollars and a half\'s worth of destruction\r\nhad been accomplished, and the stranger\'s hunger appeased, Blucher went\r\ndown to French Pete\'s, bought a veal cutlet plain, a slice of bread, and\r\nthree radishes, with his dime, and set to and feasted like a king!\r\n\r\nTake the episode all around, it was as odd as any that can be culled from\r\nthe myriad curiosities of Californian life, perhaps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\nBy and by, an old friend of mine, a miner, came down from one of the\r\ndecayed mining camps of Tuolumne, California, and I went back with him.\r\nWe lived in a small cabin on a verdant hillside, and there were not five\r\nother cabins in view over the wide expanse of hill and forest.  Yet a\r\nflourishing city of two or three thousand population had occupied this\r\ngrassy dead solitude during the flush times of twelve or fifteen years\r\nbefore, and where our cabin stood had once been the heart of the teeming\r\nhive, the centre of the city.  When the mines gave out the town fell into\r\ndecay, and in a few years wholly disappeared--streets, dwellings, shops,\r\neverything--and left no sign.  The grassy slopes were as green and smooth\r\nand desolate of life as if they had never been disturbed.  The mere\r\nhandful of miners still remaining, had seen the town spring up spread,\r\ngrow and flourish in its pride; and they had seen it sicken and die, and\r\npass away like a dream.  With it their hopes had died, and their zest of\r\nlife.  They had long ago resigned themselves to their exile, and ceased\r\nto correspond with their distant friends or turn longing eyes toward\r\ntheir early homes.  They had accepted banishment, forgotten the world and\r\nbeen forgotten of the world.  They were far from telegraphs and\r\nrailroads, and they stood, as it were, in a living grave, dead to the\r\nevents that stirred the globe\'s great populations, dead to the common\r\ninterests of men, isolated and outcast from brotherhood with their kind.\r\nIt was the most singular, and almost the most touching and melancholy\r\nexile that fancy can imagine.--One of my associates in this locality, for\r\ntwo or three months, was a man who had had a university education; but\r\nnow for eighteen years he had decayed there by inches, a bearded,\r\nrough-clad, clay-stained miner, and at times, among his sighings and\r\nsoliloquizings, he unconsciously interjected vaguely remembered Latin and\r\nGreek sentences--dead and musty tongues, meet vehicles for the thoughts\r\nof one whose dreams were all of the past, whose life was a failure; a\r\ntired man, burdened with the present, and indifferent to the future; a\r\nman without ties, hopes, interests, waiting for rest and the end.\r\n\r\nIn that one little corner of California is found a species of mining\r\nwhich is seldom or never mentioned in print.  It is called "pocket\r\nmining" and I am not aware that any of it is done outside of that little\r\ncorner.  The gold is not evenly distributed through the surface dirt, as\r\nin ordinary placer mines, but is collected in little spots, and they are\r\nvery wide apart and exceedingly hard to find, but when you do find one\r\nyou reap a rich and sudden harvest.  There are not now more than twenty\r\npocket miners in that entire little region.  I think I know every one of\r\nthem personally.  I have known one of them to hunt patiently about the\r\nhill-sides every day for eight months without finding gold enough to make\r\na snuff-box--his grocery bill running up relentlessly all the time--and\r\nthen find a pocket and take out of it two thousand dollars in two dips of\r\nhis shovel.  I have known him to take out three thousand dollars in two\r\nhours, and go and pay up every cent of his indebtedness, then enter on a\r\ndazzling spree that finished the last of his treasure before the night\r\nwas gone.  And the next day he bought his groceries on credit as usual,\r\nand shouldered his pan and shovel and went off to the hills hunting\r\npockets again happy and content.  This is the most fascinating of all the\r\ndifferent kinds of mining, and furnishes a very handsome percentage of\r\nvictims to the lunatic asylum.\r\n\r\nPocket hunting is an ingenious process.  You take a spadeful of earth\r\nfrom the hill-side and put it in a large tin pan and dissolve and wash it\r\ngradually away till nothing is left but a teaspoonful of fine sediment.\r\nWhatever gold was in that earth has remained, because, being the\r\nheaviest, it has sought the bottom.  Among the sediment you will find\r\nhalf a dozen yellow particles no larger than pin-heads.  You are\r\ndelighted.  You move off to one side and wash another pan.  If you find\r\ngold again, you move to one side further, and wash a third pan.  If you\r\nfind no gold this time, you are delighted again, because you know you are\r\non the right scent.\r\n\r\nYou lay an imaginary plan, shaped like a fan, with its handle up the\r\nhill--for just where the end of the handle is, you argue that the rich\r\ndeposit lies hidden, whose vagrant grains of gold have escaped and been\r\nwashed down the hill, spreading farther and farther apart as they\r\nwandered.  And so you proceed up the hill, washing the earth and\r\nnarrowing your lines every time the absence of gold in the pan shows that\r\nyou are outside the spread of the fan; and at last, twenty yards up the\r\nhill your lines have converged to a point--a single foot from that point\r\nyou cannot find any gold.  Your breath comes short and quick, you are\r\nfeverish with excitement; the dinner-bell may ring its clapper off, you\r\npay no attention; friends may die, weddings transpire, houses burn down,\r\nthey are nothing to you; you sweat and dig and delve with a frantic\r\ninterest--and all at once you strike it!  Up comes a spadeful of earth\r\nand quartz that is all lovely with soiled lumps and leaves and sprays of\r\ngold.  Sometimes that one spadeful is all--$500.  Sometimes the nest\r\ncontains $10,000, and it takes you three or four days to get it all out.\r\nThe pocket-miners tell of one nest that yielded $60,000 and two men\r\nexhausted it in two weeks, and then sold the ground for $10,000 to a\r\nparty who never got $300 out of it afterward.\r\n\r\nThe hogs are good pocket hunters.  All the summer they root around the\r\nbushes, and turn up a thousand little piles of dirt, and then the miners\r\nlong for the rains; for the rains beat upon these little piles and wash\r\nthem down and expose the gold, possibly right over a pocket.  Two pockets\r\nwere found in this way by the same man in one day.  One had $5,000 in it\r\nand the other $8,000.  That man could appreciate it, for he hadn\'t had a\r\ncent for about a year.\r\n\r\nIn Tuolumne lived two miners who used to go to the neighboring village in\r\nthe afternoon and return every night with household supplies.  Part of\r\nthe distance they traversed a trail, and nearly always sat down to rest\r\non a great boulder that lay beside the path.  In the course of thirteen\r\nyears they had worn that boulder tolerably smooth, sitting on it.  By and\r\nby two vagrant Mexicans came along and occupied the seat.  They began to\r\namuse themselves by chipping off flakes from the boulder with a\r\nsledge-hammer.  They examined one of these flakes and found it rich with\r\ngold. That boulder paid them $800 afterward.  But the aggravating\r\ncircumstance was that these "Greasers" knew that there must be more gold\r\nwhere that boulder came from, and so they went panning up the hill and\r\nfound what was probably the richest pocket that region has yet produced.\r\nIt took three months to exhaust it, and it yielded $120,000.  The two\r\nAmerican miners who used to sit on the boulder are poor yet, and they\r\ntake turn about in getting up early in the morning to curse those\r\nMexicans--and when it comes down to pure ornamental cursing, the native\r\nAmerican is gifted above the sons of men.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt at some length upon this matter of pocket mining because it\r\nis a subject that is seldom referred to in print, and therefore I judged\r\nthat it would have for the reader that interest which naturally attaches\r\nto novelty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\n\r\nOne of my comrades there--another of those victims of eighteen years of\r\nunrequited toil and blighted hopes--was one of the gentlest spirits that\r\never bore its patient cross in a weary exile: grave and simple Dick\r\nBaker, pocket-miner of Dead-House Gulch.--He was forty-six, gray as a\r\nrat, earnest, thoughtful, slenderly educated, slouchily dressed and\r\nclay-soiled, but his heart was finer metal than any gold his shovel ever\r\nbrought to light--than any, indeed, that ever was mined or minted.\r\n\r\nWhenever he was out of luck and a little down-hearted, he would fall to\r\nmourning over the loss of a wonderful cat he used to own (for where women\r\nand children are not, men of kindly impulses take up with pets, for they\r\nmust love something).  And he always spoke of the strange sagacity of\r\nthat cat with the air of a man who believed in his secret heart that\r\nthere was something human about it--may be even supernatural.\r\n\r\nI heard him talking about this animal once.  He said:\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, I used to have a cat here, by the name of Tom Quartz, which\r\nyou\'d a took an interest in I reckon--most any body would.  I had him\r\nhere eight year--and he was the remarkablest cat I ever see.  He was a\r\nlarge gray one of the Tom specie, an\' he had more hard, natchral sense\r\nthan any man in this camp--\'n\' a power of dignity--he wouldn\'t let the\r\nGov\'ner of Californy be familiar with him.  He never ketched a rat in his\r\nlife--\'peared to be above it.  He never cared for nothing but mining.\r\nHe knowed more about mining, that cat did, than any man I ever, ever see.\r\nYou couldn\'t tell him noth\'n \'bout placer diggin\'s--\'n\' as for pocket\r\nmining, why he was just born for it.\r\n\r\n"He would dig out after me an\' Jim when we went over the hills\r\nprospect\'n\', and he would trot along behind us for as much as five mile,\r\nif we went so fur.  An\' he had the best judgment about mining ground--why\r\nyou never see anything like it.  When we went to work, he\'d scatter a\r\nglance around, \'n\' if he didn\'t think much of the indications, he would\r\ngive a look as much as to say, \'Well, I\'ll have to get you to excuse me,\'\r\n\'n\' without another word he\'d hyste his nose into the air \'n\' shove for\r\nhome.  But if the ground suited him, he would lay low \'n\' keep dark till\r\nthe first pan was washed, \'n\' then he would sidle up \'n\' take a look, an\'\r\nif there was about six or seven grains of gold he was satisfied--he\r\ndidn\'t want no better prospect \'n\' that--\'n\' then he would lay down on\r\nour coats and snore like a steamboat till we\'d struck the pocket, an\'\r\nthen get up \'n\' superintend.  He was nearly lightnin\' on superintending.\r\n\r\n"Well, bye an\' bye, up comes this yer quartz excitement.  Every body was\r\ninto it--every body was pick\'n\' \'n\' blast\'n\' instead of shovelin\' dirt on\r\nthe hill side--every body was put\'n\' down a shaft instead of scrapin\' the\r\nsurface.  Noth\'n\' would do Jim, but we must tackle the ledges, too, \'n\'\r\nso we did.  We commenced put\'n\' down a shaft, \'n\' Tom Quartz he begin to\r\nwonder what in the Dickens it was all about.  He hadn\'t ever seen any\r\nmining like that before, \'n\' he was all upset, as you may say--he\r\ncouldn\'t come to a right understanding of it no way--it was too many for\r\nhim.  He was down on it, too, you bet you--he was down on it powerful\r\n--\'n\' always appeared to consider it the cussedest foolishness out.  But\r\nthat cat, you know, was always agin new fangled arrangements--somehow he\r\nnever could abide\'em.  You know how it is with old habits.  But by an\' by\r\nTom Quartz begin to git sort of reconciled a little, though he never\r\ncould altogether understand that eternal sinkin\' of a shaft an\' never\r\npannin\' out any thing.  At last he got to comin\' down in the shaft,\r\nhisself, to try to cipher it out.  An\' when he\'d git the blues, \'n\' feel\r\nkind o\'scruffy, \'n\' aggravated \'n\' disgusted--knowin\' as he did, that the\r\nbills was runnin\' up all the time an\' we warn\'t makin\' a cent--he would\r\ncurl up on a gunny sack in the corner an\' go to sleep.  Well, one day\r\nwhen the shaft was down about eight foot, the rock got so hard that we\r\nhad to put in a blast--the first blast\'n\' we\'d ever done since Tom Quartz\r\nwas born.  An\' then we lit the fuse \'n\' clumb out \'n\' got off \'bout fifty\r\nyards--\'n\' forgot \'n\' left Tom Quartz sound asleep on the gunny sack.\r\n\r\n"In \'bout a minute we seen a puff of smoke bust up out of the hole, \'n\'\r\nthen everything let go with an awful crash, \'n\' about four million ton of\r\nrocks \'n\' dirt \'n\' smoke \'n; splinters shot up \'bout a mile an\' a half\r\ninto the air, an\' by George, right in the dead centre of it was old Tom\r\nQuartz a goin\' end over end, an\' a snortin\' an\' a sneez\'n\', an\' a clawin\'\r\nan\' a reachin\' for things like all possessed.  But it warn\'t no use, you\r\nknow, it warn\'t no use.  An\' that was the last we see of him for about\r\ntwo minutes \'n\' a half, an\' then all of a sudden it begin to rain rocks\r\nand rubbage, an\' directly he come down ker-whop about ten foot off f\'m\r\nwhere we stood Well, I reckon he was p\'raps the orneriest lookin\' beast\r\nyou ever see.  One ear was sot back on his neck, \'n\' his tail was stove\r\nup, \'n\' his eye-winkers was swinged off, \'n\' he was all blacked up with\r\npowder an\' smoke, an\' all sloppy with mud \'n\' slush f\'m one end to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n"Well sir, it warn\'t no use to try to apologize--we couldn\'t say a word.\r\nHe took a sort of a disgusted look at hisself, \'n\' then he looked at us\r\n--an\' it was just exactly the same as if he had said--\'Gents, may be you\r\nthink it\'s smart to take advantage of a cat that \'ain\'t had no experience\r\nof quartz minin\', but I think different\'--an\' then he turned on his heel\r\n\'n\' marched off home without ever saying another word.\r\n\r\n"That was jest his style.  An\' may be you won\'t believe it, but after\r\nthat you never see a cat so prejudiced agin quartz mining as what he was.\r\nAn\' by an\' bye when he did get to goin\' down in the shaft agin, you\'d \'a\r\nbeen astonished at his sagacity.  The minute we\'d tetch off a blast \'n\'\r\nthe fuse\'d begin to sizzle, he\'d give a look as much as to say: \'Well,\r\nI\'ll have to git you to excuse me,\' an\' it was surpris\'n\' the way he\'d\r\nshin out of that hole \'n\' go f\'r a tree.  Sagacity?  It ain\'t no name for\r\nit.  \'Twas inspiration!"\r\n\r\nI said, "Well, Mr. Baker, his prejudice against quartz-mining was\r\nremarkable, considering how he came by it.  Couldn\'t you ever cure him of\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"Cure him!  No!  When Tom Quartz was sot once, he was always sot--and you\r\nmight a blowed him up as much as three million times \'n\' you\'d never a\r\nbroken him of his cussed prejudice agin quartz mining."\r\n\r\nThe affection and the pride that lit up Baker\'s face when he delivered\r\nthis tribute to the firmness of his humble friend of other days, will\r\nalways be a vivid memory with me.\r\n\r\nAt the end of two months we had never "struck" a pocket.  We had panned\r\nup and down the hillsides till they looked plowed like a field; we could\r\nhave put in a crop of grain, then, but there would have been no way to\r\nget it to market.  We got many good "prospects," but when the gold gave\r\nout in the pan and we dug down, hoping and longing, we found only\r\nemptiness--the pocket that should have been there was as barren as our\r\nown.--At last we shouldered our pans and shovels and struck out over the\r\nhills to try new localities.  We prospected around Angel\'s Camp, in\r\nCalaveras county, during three weeks, but had no success.  Then we\r\nwandered on foot among the mountains, sleeping under the trees at night,\r\nfor the weather was mild, but still we remained as centless as the last\r\nrose of summer.  That is a poor joke, but it is in pathetic harmony with\r\nthe circumstances, since we were so poor ourselves.  In accordance with\r\nthe custom of the country, our door had always stood open and our board\r\nwelcome to tramping miners--they drifted along nearly every day, dumped\r\ntheir paust shovels by the threshold and took "pot luck" with us--and now\r\non our own tramp we never found cold hospitality.\r\n\r\nOur wanderings were wide and in many directions; and now I could give the\r\nreader a vivid description of the Big Trees and the marvels of the Yo\r\nSemite--but what has this reader done to me that I should persecute him?\r\nI will deliver him into the hands of less conscientious tourists and take\r\nhis blessing.  Let me be charitable, though I fail in all virtues else.\r\n\r\nNote: Some of the phrases in the above are mining technicalities, purely,\r\nand may be a little obscure to the general reader.  In "placer diggings"\r\nthe gold is scattered all through the surface dirt; in "pocket" diggings\r\nit is concentrated in one little spot; in "quartz" the gold is in a\r\nsolid, continuous vein of rock, enclosed between distinct walls of some\r\nother kind of stone--and this is the most laborious and expensive of all\r\nthe different kinds of mining.  "Prospecting" is hunting for a "placer";\r\n"indications" are signs of its presence; "panning out" refers to the\r\nwashing process by which the grains of gold are separated from the dirt;\r\na "prospect" is what one finds in the first panful of dirt--and its value\r\ndetermines whether it is a good or a bad prospect, and whether it is\r\nworth while to tarry there or seek further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\n\r\nAfter a three months\' absence, I found myself in San Francisco again,\r\nwithout a cent.  When my credit was about exhausted, (for I had become\r\ntoo mean and lazy, now, to work on a morning paper, and there were no\r\nvacancies on the evening journals,) I was created San Francisco\r\ncorrespondent of the Enterprise, and at the end of five months I was out\r\nof debt, but my interest in my work was gone; for my correspondence being\r\na daily one, without rest or respite, I got unspeakably tired of it.\r\nI wanted another change.  The vagabond instinct was strong upon me.\r\nFortune favored and I got a new berth and a delightful one.  It was to go\r\ndown to the Sandwich Islands and write some letters for the Sacramento\r\nUnion, an excellent journal and liberal with employees.\r\n\r\nWe sailed in the propeller Ajax, in the middle of winter.  The almanac\r\ncalled it winter, distinctly enough, but the weather was a compromise\r\nbetween spring and summer.  Six days out of port, it became summer\r\naltogether.  We had some thirty passengers; among them a cheerful soul\r\nby the name of Williams, and three sea-worn old whaleship captains going\r\ndown to join their vessels.  These latter played euchre in the smoking\r\nroom day and night, drank astonishing quantities of raw whisky without\r\nbeing in the least affected by it, and were the happiest people I think\r\nI ever saw.  And then there was "the old Admiral--"  a retired whaleman.\r\nHe was a roaring, terrific combination of wind and lightning and thunder,\r\nand earnest, whole-souled profanity.  But nevertheless he was\r\ntender-hearted as a girl.  He was a raving, deafening, devastating\r\ntyphoon, laying waste the cowering seas but with an unvexed refuge in the\r\ncentre where all comers were safe and at rest.  Nobody could know the\r\n"Admiral" without liking him; and in a sudden and dire emergency I think\r\nno friend of his would know which to choose--to be cursed by him or\r\nprayed for by a less efficient person.\r\n\r\nHis Title of "Admiral" was more strictly "official" than any ever worn by\r\na naval officer before or since, perhaps--for it was the voluntary\r\noffering of a whole nation, and came direct from the people themselves\r\nwithout any intermediate red tape--the people of the Sandwich Islands.\r\nIt was a title that came to him freighted with affection, and honor, and\r\nappreciation of his unpretending merit.  And in testimony of the\r\ngenuineness of the title it was publicly ordained that an exclusive flag\r\nshould be devised for him and used solely to welcome his coming and wave\r\nhim God-speed in his going.  From that time forth, whenever his ship was\r\nsignaled in the offing, or he catted his anchor and stood out to sea,\r\nthat ensign streamed from the royal halliards on the parliament house and\r\nthe nation lifted their hats to it with spontaneous accord.\r\n\r\nYet he had never fired a gun or fought a battle in his life.  When I knew\r\nhim on board the Ajax, he was seventy-two years old and had plowed the\r\nsalt water sixty-one of them.  For sixteen years he had gone in and out\r\nof the harbor of Honolulu in command of a whaleship, and for sixteen more\r\nhad been captain of a San Francisco and Sandwich Island passenger packet\r\nand had never had an accident or lost a vessel.  The simple natives knew\r\nhim for a friend who never failed them, and regarded him as children\r\nregard a father.  It was a dangerous thing to oppress them when the\r\nroaring Admiral was around.\r\n\r\nTwo years before I knew the Admiral, he had retired from the sea on a\r\ncompetence, and had sworn a colossal nine-jointed oath that he would\r\n"never go within smelling distance of the salt water again as long as he\r\nlived."  And he had conscientiously kept it.  That is to say, he\r\nconsidered he had kept it, and it would have been more than dangerous to\r\nsuggest to him, even in the gentlest way, that making eleven long sea\r\nvoyages, as a passenger, during the two years that had transpired since\r\nhe "retired," was only keeping the general spirit of it and not the\r\nstrict letter.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral knew only one narrow line of conduct to pursue in any and all\r\ncases where there was a fight, and that was to shoulder his way straight\r\nin without an inquiry as to the rights or the merits of it, and take the\r\npart of the weaker side.--And this was the reason why he was always sure\r\nto be present at the trial of any universally execrated criminal to\r\noppress and intimidate the jury with a vindictive pantomime of what he\r\nwould do to them if he ever caught them out of the box.  And this was why\r\nharried cats and outlawed dogs that knew him confidently took sanctuary\r\nunder his chair in time of trouble.  In the beginning he was the most\r\nfrantic and bloodthirsty Union man that drew breath in the shadow of the\r\nFlag; but the instant the Southerners began to go down before the sweep\r\nof the Northern armies, he ran up the Confederate colors and from that\r\ntime till the end was a rampant and inexorable secessionist.\r\n\r\nHe hated intemperance with a more uncompromising animosity than any\r\nindividual I have ever met, of either sex; and he was never tired of\r\nstorming against it and beseeching friends and strangers alike to be wary\r\nand drink with moderation.  And yet if any creature had been guileless\r\nenough to intimate that his absorbing nine gallons of "straight" whiskey\r\nduring our voyage was any fraction short of rigid or inflexible\r\nabstemiousness, in that self-same moment the old man would have spun him\r\nto the uttermost parts of the earth in the whirlwind of his wrath.  Mind,\r\nI am not saying his whisky ever affected his head or his legs, for it did\r\nnot, in even the slightest degree.  He was a capacious container, but he\r\ndid not hold enough for that.  He took a level tumblerful of whisky every\r\nmorning before he put his clothes on--"to sweeten his bilgewater," he\r\nsaid.--He took another after he got the most of his clothes on, "to\r\nsettle his mind and give him his bearings."  He then shaved, and put on a\r\nclean shirt; after which he recited the Lord\'s Prayer in a fervent,\r\nthundering bass that shook the ship to her kelson and suspended all\r\nconversation in the main cabin.  Then, at this stage, being invariably\r\n"by the head," or "by the stern," or "listed to port or starboard," he\r\ntook one more to "put him on an even keel so that he would mind his\r\nhellum and not miss stays and go about, every time he came up in the\r\nwind."--And now, his state-room door swung open and the sun of his\r\nbenignant face beamed redly out upon men and women and children, and he\r\nroared his "Shipmets a\'hoy!" in a way that was calculated to wake the\r\ndead and precipitate the final resurrection; and forth he strode, a\r\npicture to look at and a presence to enforce attention.  Stalwart and\r\nportly; not a gray hair; broadbrimmed slouch hat; semi-sailor toggery of\r\nblue navy flannel--roomy and ample; a stately expanse of shirt-front and\r\na liberal amount of black silk neck-cloth tied with a sailor knot; large\r\nchain and imposing seals impending from his fob; awe-inspiring feet, and\r\n"a hand like the hand of Providence," as his whaling brethren expressed\r\nit; wrist-bands and sleeves pushed back half way to the elbow, out of\r\nrespect for the warm weather, and exposing hairy arms, gaudy with red and\r\nblue anchors, ships, and goddesses of liberty tattooed in India ink.\r\nBut these details were only secondary matters--his face was the lodestone\r\nthat chained the eye.  It was a sultry disk, glowing determinedly out\r\nthrough a weather beaten mask of mahogany, and studded with warts, seamed\r\nwith scars, "blazed" all over with unfailing fresh slips of the razor;\r\nand with cheery eyes, under shaggy brows, contemplating the world from\r\nover the back of a gnarled crag of a nose that loomed vast and lonely out\r\nof the undulating immensity that spread away from its foundations.\r\nAt his heels frisked the darling of his bachelor estate, his terrier\r\n"Fan," a creature no larger than a squirrel.  The main part of his daily\r\nlife was occupied in looking after "Fan," in a motherly way, and\r\ndoctoring her for a hundred ailments which existed only in his\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral seldom read newspapers; and when he did he never believed\r\nanything they said.  He read nothing, and believed in nothing, but "The\r\nOld Guard," a secession periodical published in New York.  He carried a\r\ndozen copies of it with him, always, and referred to them for all\r\nrequired information.  If it was not there, he supplied it himself, out\r\nof a bountiful fancy, inventing history, names, dates, and every thing\r\nelse necessary to make his point good in an argument.  Consequently he\r\nwas a formidable antagonist in a dispute.  Whenever he swung clear of the\r\nrecord and began to create history, the enemy was helpless and had to\r\nsurrender.  Indeed, the enemy could not keep from betraying some little\r\nspark of indignation at his manufactured history--and when it came to\r\nindignation, that was the Admiral\'s very "best hold."  He was always\r\nready for a political argument, and if nobody started one he would do it\r\nhimself.  With his third retort his temper would begin to rise, and\r\nwithin five minutes he would be blowing a gale, and within fifteen his\r\nsmoking-room audience would be utterly stormed away and the old man left\r\nsolitary and alone, banging the table with his fist, kicking the chairs,\r\nand roaring a hurricane of profanity.  It got so, after a while, that\r\nwhenever the Admiral approached, with politics in his eye, the passengers\r\nwould drop out with quiet accord, afraid to meet him; and he would camp\r\non a deserted field.\r\n\r\nBut he found his match at last, and before a full company.  At one time\r\nor another, everybody had entered the lists against him and been routed,\r\nexcept the quiet passenger Williams.  He had never been able to get an\r\nexpression of opinion out of him on politics.  But now, just as the\r\nAdmiral drew near the door and the company were about to slip out,\r\nWilliams said:\r\n\r\n"Admiral, are you certain about that circumstance concerning the\r\nclergymen you mentioned the other day?"--referring to a piece of the\r\nAdmiral\'s manufactured history.\r\n\r\nEvery one was amazed at the man\'s rashness.  The idea of deliberately\r\ninviting annihilation was a thing incomprehensible.  The retreat came to\r\na halt; then everybody sat down again wondering, to await the upshot of\r\nit.  The Admiral himself was as surprised as any one.  He paused in the\r\ndoor, with his red handkerchief half raised to his sweating face, and\r\ncontemplated the daring reptile in the corner.\r\n\r\n"Certain of it?  Am I certain of it?  Do you think I\'ve been lying about\r\nit?  What do you take me for?  Anybody that don\'t know that circumstance,\r\ndon\'t know anything; a child ought to know it.  Read up your history!\r\nRead it up-----, and don\'t come asking a man if he\'s certain about a bit\r\nof ABC stuff that the very southern niggers know all about."\r\n\r\nHere the Admiral\'s fires began to wax hot, the atmosphere thickened, the\r\ncoming earthquake rumbled, he began to thunder and lighten.  Within three\r\nminutes his volcano was in full irruption and he was discharging flames\r\nand ashes of indignation, belching black volumes of foul history aloft,\r\nand vomiting red-hot torrents of profanity from his crater.  Meantime\r\nWilliams sat silent, and apparently deeply and earnestly interested in\r\nwhat the old man was saying.  By and by, when the lull came, he said in\r\nthe most deferential way, and with the gratified air of a man who has had\r\na mystery cleared up which had been puzzling him uncomfortably:\r\n\r\n"Now I understand it.  I always thought I knew that piece of history well\r\nenough, but was still afraid to trust it, because there was not that\r\nconvincing particularity about it that one likes to have in history; but\r\nwhen you mentioned every name, the other day, and every date, and every\r\nlittle circumstance, in their just order and sequence, I said to myself,\r\nthis sounds something like--this is history--this is putting it in a\r\nshape that gives a man confidence; and I said to myself afterward, I will\r\njust ask the Admiral if he is perfectly certain about the details, and if\r\nhe is I will come out and thank him for clearing this matter up for me.\r\nAnd that is what I want to do now--for until you set that matter right it\r\nwas nothing but just a confusion in my mind, without head or tail to it."\r\n\r\nNobody ever saw the Admiral look so mollified before, and so pleased.\r\nNobody had ever received his bogus history as gospel before; its\r\ngenuineness had always been called in question either by words or looks;\r\nbut here was a man that not only swallowed it all down, but was grateful\r\nfor the dose.  He was taken a back; he hardly knew what to say; even his\r\nprofanity failed him.  Now, Williams continued, modestly and earnestly:\r\n\r\n"But Admiral, in saying that this was the first stone thrown, and that\r\nthis precipitated the war, you have overlooked a circumstance which you\r\nare perfectly familiar with, but which has escaped your memory.  Now I\r\ngrant you that what you have stated is correct in every detail--to wit:\r\nthat on the 16th of October, 1860, two Massachusetts clergymen, named\r\nWaite and Granger, went in disguise to the house of John Moody, in\r\nRockport, at dead of night, and dragged forth two southern women and\r\ntheir two little children, and after tarring and feathering them conveyed\r\nthem to Boston and burned them alive in the State House square; and I\r\nalso grant your proposition that this deed is what led to the secession\r\nof South Carolina on the 20th of December following.  Very well."  [Here\r\nthe company were pleasantly surprised to hear Williams proceed to come\r\nback at the Admiral with his own invincible weapon--clean, pure,\r\nmanufactured history, without a word of truth in it.]  "Very well, I say.\r\nBut Admiral, why overlook the Willis and Morgan case in South Carolina?\r\nYou are too well informed a man not to know all about that circumstance.\r\nYour arguments and your conversations have shown you to be intimately\r\nconversant with every detail of this national quarrel.  You develop\r\nmatters of history every day that show plainly that you are no smatterer\r\nin it, content to nibble about the surface, but a man who has searched\r\nthe depths and possessed yourself of everything that has a bearing upon\r\nthe great question.  Therefore, let me just recall to your mind that\r\nWillis and Morgan case--though I see by your face that the whole thing is\r\nalready passing through your memory at this moment.  On the 12th of\r\nAugust, 1860, two months before the Waite and Granger affair, two South\r\nCarolina clergymen, named John H. Morgan and Winthrop L.  Willis, one a\r\nMethodist and the other an Old School Baptist, disguised themselves, and\r\nwent at midnight to the house of a planter named Thompson--Archibald F.\r\nThompson, Vice President under Thomas Jefferson,--and took thence, at\r\nmidnight, his widowed aunt, (a Northern woman,) and her adopted child, an\r\norphan--named Mortimer Highie, afflicted with epilepsy and suffering at\r\nthe time from white swelling on one of his legs, and compelled to walk on\r\ncrutches in consequence; and the two ministers, in spite of the pleadings\r\nof the victims, dragged them to the bush, tarred and feathered them, and\r\nafterward burned them at the stake in the city of Charleston.  You\r\nremember perfectly well what a stir it made; you remember perfectly well\r\nthat even the Charleston Courier stigmatized the act as being unpleasant,\r\nof questionable propriety, and scarcely justifiable, and likewise that it\r\nwould not be matter of surprise if retaliation ensued.  And you remember\r\nalso, that this thing was the cause of the Massachusetts outrage.  Who,\r\nindeed, were the two Massachusetts ministers?  and who were the two\r\nSouthern women they burned?  I do not need to remind you, Admiral, with\r\nyour intimate knowledge of history, that Waite was the nephew of the\r\nwoman burned in Charleston; that Granger was her cousin in the second\r\ndegree, and that the woman they burned in Boston was the wife of John H.\r\nMorgan, and the still loved but divorced wife of Winthrop L. Willis.\r\nNow, Admiral, it is only fair that you should acknowledge that the first\r\nprovocation came from the Southern preachers and that the Northern ones\r\nwere justified in retaliating.  In your arguments you never yet have\r\nshown the least disposition to withhold a just verdict or be in anywise\r\nunfair, when authoritative history condemned your position, and therefore\r\nI have no hesitation in asking you to take the original blame from the\r\nMassachusetts ministers, in this matter, and transfer it to the South\r\nCarolina clergymen where it justly belongs."\r\n\r\nThe Admiral was conquered.  This sweet spoken creature who swallowed his\r\nfraudulent history as if it were the bread of life; basked in his furious\r\nblasphemy as if it were generous sunshine; found only calm, even-handed\r\njustice in his rampart partisanship; and flooded him with invented\r\nhistory so sugarcoated with flattery and deference that there was no\r\nrejecting it, was "too many" for him.  He stammered some awkward, profane\r\nsentences about the-----Willis and Morgan business having escaped his\r\nmemory, but that he "remembered it now," and then, under pretence of\r\ngiving Fan some medicine for an imaginary cough, drew out of the battle\r\nand went away, a vanquished man.  Then cheers and laughter went up, and\r\nWilliams, the ship\'s benefactor was a hero.  The news went about the\r\nvessel, champagne was ordered, and enthusiastic reception instituted in\r\nthe smoking room, and everybody flocked thither to shake hands with the\r\nconqueror.  The wheelman said afterward, that the Admiral stood up behind\r\nthe pilot house and "ripped and cursed all to himself" till he loosened\r\nthe smokestack guys and becalmed the mainsail.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral\'s power was broken.  After that, if he began argument,\r\nsomebody would bring Williams, and the old man would grow weak and begin\r\nto quiet down at once.  And as soon as he was done, Williams in his\r\ndulcet, insinuating way, would invent some history (referring for proof,\r\nto the old man\'s own excellent memory and to copies of "The Old Guard"\r\nknown not to be in his possession) that would turn the tables completely\r\nand leave the Admiral all abroad and helpless.  By and by he came to so\r\ndread Williams and his gilded tongue that he would stop talking when he\r\nsaw him approach, and finally ceased to mention politics altogether, and\r\nfrom that time forward there was entire peace and serenity in the ship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII.\r\n\r\nOn a certain bright morning the Islands hove in sight, lying low on the\r\nlonely sea, and everybody climbed to the upper deck to look.  After two\r\nthousand miles of watery solitude the vision was a welcome one.  As we\r\napproached, the imposing promontory of Diamond Head rose up out of the\r\nocean its rugged front softened by the hazy distance, and presently the\r\ndetails of the land began to make themselves manifest: first the line of\r\nbeach; then the plumed coacoanut trees of the tropics; then cabins of the\r\nnatives; then the white town of Honolulu, said to contain between twelve\r\nand fifteen thousand inhabitants spread over a dead level; with streets\r\nfrom twenty to thirty feet wide, solid and level as a floor, most of them\r\nstraight as a line and few as crooked as a corkscrew.\r\n\r\nThe further I traveled through the town the better I liked it.\r\nEvery step revealed a new contrast--disclosed something I was\r\nunaccustomed to. In place of the grand mud-colored brown fronts of\r\nSan Francisco, I saw dwellings built of straw, adobies, and cream-colored\r\npebble-and-shell-conglomerated coral, cut into oblong blocks and laid in\r\ncement; also a great number of neat white cottages, with green\r\nwindow-shutters; in place of front yards like billiard-tables with iron\r\nfences around them, I saw these homes surrounded by ample yards, thickly\r\nclad with green grass, and shaded by tall trees, through whose dense\r\nfoliage the sun could scarcely penetrate; in place of the customary\r\ngeranium, calla lily, etc., languishing in dust and general debility, I\r\nsaw luxurious banks and thickets of flowers, fresh as a meadow after a\r\nrain, and glowing with the richest dyes; in place of the dingy horrors of\r\nSan Francisco\'s pleasure grove, the "Willows," I saw huge-bodied,\r\nwide-spreading forest trees, with strange names and stranger appearance\r\n--trees that cast a shadow like a thunder-cloud, and were able to stand\r\nalone without being tied to green poles; in place of gold fish, wiggling\r\naround in glass globes, assuming countless shades and degrees of\r\ndistortion through the magnifying and diminishing qualities of their\r\ntransparent prison houses, I saw cats--Tom-cats, Mary Ann cats,\r\nlong-tailed cats, bob-tailed cats, blind cats, one-eyed cats, wall-eyed\r\ncats, cross-eyed cats, gray cats, black cats, white cats, yellow cats,\r\nstriped cats, spotted cats, tame cats, wild cats, singed cats, individual\r\ncats, groups of cats, platoons of cats, companies of cats, regiments of\r\ncats, armies of cats, multitudes of cats, millions of cats, and all of\r\nthem sleek, fat, lazy and sound asleep. I looked on a multitude of\r\npeople, some white, in white coats, vests, pantaloons, even white cloth\r\nshoes, made snowy with chalk duly laid on every morning; but the majority\r\nof the people were almost as dark as negroes--women with comely features,\r\nfine black eyes, rounded forms, inclining to the voluptuous, clad in a\r\nsingle bright red or white garment that fell free and unconfined from\r\nshoulder to heel, long black hair falling loose, gypsy hats, encircled\r\nwith wreaths of natural flowers of a brilliant carmine tint; plenty of\r\ndark men in various costumes, and some with nothing on but a battered\r\nstove-pipe hat tilted on the nose, and a very scant breech-clout;\r\n--certain smoke-dried children were clothed in nothing but sunshine\r\n--a very neat fitting and picturesque apparel indeed.\r\n\r\nIn place of roughs and rowdies staring and blackguarding on the corners,\r\nI saw long-haired, saddle-colored Sandwich Island maidens sitting on the\r\nground in the shade of corner houses, gazing indolently at whatever or\r\nwhoever happened along; instead of wretched cobble-stone pavements, I\r\nwalked on a firm foundation of coral, built up from the bottom of the sea\r\nby the absurd but persevering insect of that name, with a light layer of\r\nlava and cinders overlying the coral, belched up out of fathomless\r\nperdition long ago through the seared and blackened crater that stands\r\ndead and harmless in the distance now; instead of cramped and crowded\r\nstreet-cars, I met dusky native women sweeping by, free as the wind, on\r\nfleet horses and astride, with gaudy riding-sashes, streaming like\r\nbanners behind them; instead of the combined stenches of Chinadom and\r\nBrannan street slaughter-houses, I breathed the balmy fragrance of\r\njessamine, oleander, and the Pride of India; in place of the hurry and\r\nbustle and noisy confusion of San Francisco, I moved in the midst of a\r\nSummer calm as tranquil as dawn in the Garden of Eden; in place of the\r\nGolden City\'s skirting sand hills and the placid bay, I saw on the one\r\nside a frame-work of tall, precipitous mountains close at hand, clad in\r\nrefreshing green, and cleft by deep, cool, chasm-like valleys--and in\r\nfront the grand sweep of the ocean; a brilliant, transparent green near\r\nthe shore, bound and bordered by a long white line of foamy spray dashing\r\nagainst the reef, and further out the dead blue water of the deep sea,\r\nflecked with "white caps," and in the far horizon a single, lonely sail\r\n--a mere accent-mark to emphasize a slumberous calm and a solitude that\r\nwere without sound or limit.  When the sun sunk down--the one intruder\r\nfrom other realms and persistent in suggestions of them--it was tranced\r\nluxury to sit in the perfumed air and forget that there was any world but\r\nthese enchanted islands.\r\n\r\nIt was such ecstacy to dream, and dream--till you got a bite.\r\n\r\nA scorpion bite.  Then the first duty was to get up out of the grass and\r\nkill the scorpion; and the next to bathe the bitten place with alcohol or\r\nbrandy; and the next to resolve to keep out of the grass in future.  Then\r\ncame an adjournment to the bed-chamber and the pastime of writing up the\r\nday\'s journal with one hand and the destruction of mosquitoes with the\r\nother--a whole community of them at a slap.  Then, observing an enemy\r\napproaching,--a hairy tarantula on stilts--why not set the spittoon on\r\nhim?  It is done, and the projecting ends of his paws give a luminous\r\nidea of the magnitude of his reach.  Then to bed and become a promenade\r\nfor a centipede with forty-two legs on a side and every foot hot enough\r\nto burn a hole through a raw-hide.  More soaking with alcohol, and a\r\nresolution to examine the bed before entering it, in future.  Then wait,\r\nand suffer, till all the mosquitoes in the neighborhood have crawled in\r\nunder the bar, then slip out quickly, shut them in and sleep peacefully\r\non the floor till morning.  Meantime it is comforting to curse the\r\ntropics in occasional wakeful intervals.\r\n\r\nWe had an abundance of fruit in Honolulu, of course.  Oranges,\r\npine-apples, bananas, strawberries, lemons, limes, mangoes, guavas,\r\nmelons, and a rare and curious luxury called the chirimoya, which is\r\ndeliciousness itself.  Then there is the tamarind.  I thought tamarinds\r\nwere made to eat, but that was probably not the idea.  I ate several, and\r\nit seemed to me that they were rather sour that year.  They pursed up my\r\nlips, till they resembled the stem-end of a tomato, and I had to take my\r\nsustenance through a quill for twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThey sharpened my teeth till I could have shaved with them, and gave them\r\na "wire edge" that I was afraid would stay; but a citizen said "no, it\r\nwill come off when the enamel does"--which was comforting, at any rate.\r\nI found, afterward, that only strangers eat tamarinds--but they only eat\r\nthem once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV.\r\n\r\nIn my diary of our third day in Honolulu, I find this:\r\n\r\nI am probably the most sensitive man in Hawaii to-night--especially about\r\nsitting down in the presence of my betters.  I have ridden fifteen or\r\ntwenty miles on horse-back since 5 P.M.  and to tell the honest truth, I\r\nhave a delicacy about sitting down at all.\r\n\r\nAn excursion to Diamond Head and the King\'s Coacoanut Grove was planned\r\nto-day--time, 4:30 P.M.--the party to consist of half a dozen gentlemen\r\nand three ladies.  They all started at the appointed hour except myself.\r\nI was at the Government prison, (with Captain Fish and another\r\nwhaleship-skipper, Captain Phillips,) and got so interested in its\r\nexamination that I did not notice how quickly the time was passing.\r\nSomebody remarked that it was twenty minutes past five o\'clock, and that\r\nwoke me up.  It was a fortunate circumstance that Captain Phillips was\r\nalong with his "turn out," as he calls a top-buggy that Captain Cook\r\nbrought here in 1778, and a horse that was here when Captain Cook came.\r\nCaptain Phillips takes a just pride in his driving and in the speed of\r\nhis horse, and to his passion for displaying them I owe it that we were\r\nonly sixteen minutes coming from the prison to the American Hotel--a\r\ndistance which has been estimated to be over half a mile.  But it took\r\nsome fearful driving.  The Captain\'s whip came down fast, and the blows\r\nstarted so much dust out of the horse\'s hide that during the last half of\r\nthe journey we rode through an impenetrable fog, and ran by a pocket\r\ncompass in the hands of Captain Fish, a whaler of twenty-six years\r\nexperience, who sat there through the perilous voyage as self-possessed\r\nas if he had been on the euchre-deck of his own ship, and calmly said,\r\n"Port your helm--port," from time to time, and "Hold her a little free\r\n--steady--so--so," and "Luff--hard down to starboard!" and never once\r\nlost his presence of mind or betrayed the least anxiety by voice or\r\nmanner. When we came to anchor at last, and Captain Phillips looked at\r\nhis watch and said, "Sixteen minutes--I told you it was in her!  that\'s\r\nover three miles an hour!" I could see he felt entitled to a compliment,\r\nand so I said I had never seen lightning go like that horse.  And I never\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nThe landlord of the American said the party had been gone nearly an hour,\r\nbut that he could give me my choice of several horses that could overtake\r\nthem.  I said, never mind--I preferred a safe horse to a fast one--I\r\nwould like to have an excessively gentle horse--a horse with no spirit\r\nwhatever--a lame one, if he had such a thing.  Inside of five minutes I\r\nwas mounted, and perfectly satisfied with my outfit.  I had no time to\r\nlabel him "This is a horse," and so if the public took him for a sheep I\r\ncannot help it.  I was satisfied, and that was the main thing.  I could\r\nsee that he had as many fine points as any man\'s horse, and so I hung my\r\nhat on one of them, behind the saddle, and swabbed the perspiration from\r\nmy face and started.  I named him after this island, "Oahu" (pronounced\r\nO-waw-hee).  The first gate he came to he started in; I had neither whip\r\nnor spur, and so I simply argued the case with him.  He resisted\r\nargument, but ultimately yielded to insult and abuse.  He backed out of\r\nthat gate and steered for another one on the other side of the street.\r\nI triumphed by my former process.  Within the next six hundred yards he\r\ncrossed the street fourteen times and attempted thirteen gates, and in\r\nthe meantime the tropical sun was beating down and threatening to cave\r\nthe top of my head in, and I was literally dripping with perspiration.\r\nHe abandoned the gate business after that and went along peaceably\r\nenough, but absorbed in meditation.  I noticed this latter circumstance,\r\nand it soon began to fill me with apprehension.  I said to my self, this\r\ncreature is planning some new outrage, some fresh deviltry or other--no\r\nhorse ever thought over a subject so profoundly as this one is doing just\r\nfor nothing.  The more this thing preyed upon my mind the more uneasy I\r\nbecame, until the suspense became almost unbearable and I dismounted to\r\nsee if there was anything wild in his eye--for I had heard that the eye\r\nof this noblest of our domestic animals is very expressive.\r\n\r\nI cannot describe what a load of anxiety was lifted from my mind when I\r\nfound that he was only asleep.  I woke him up and started him into a\r\nfaster walk, and then the villainy of his nature came out again.  He\r\ntried to climb over a stone wall, five or six feet high.  I saw that I\r\nmust apply force to this horse, and that I might as well begin first as\r\nlast.  I plucked a stout switch from a tamarind tree, and the moment he\r\nsaw it, he surrendered.  He broke into a convulsive sort of a canter,\r\nwhich had three short steps in it and one long one, and reminded me\r\nalternately of the clattering shake of the great earthquake, and the\r\nsweeping plunging of the Ajax in a storm.\r\n\r\nAnd now there can be no fitter occasion than the present to pronounce a\r\nleft-handed blessing upon the man who invented the American saddle.\r\nThere is no seat to speak of about it--one might as well sit in a shovel\r\n--and the stirrups are nothing but an ornamental nuisance.  If I were to\r\nwrite down here all the abuse I expended on those stirrups, it would make\r\na large book, even without pictures.  Sometimes I got one foot so far\r\nthrough, that the stirrup partook of the nature of an anklet; sometimes\r\nboth feet were through, and I was handcuffed by the legs; and sometimes\r\nmy feet got clear out and left the stirrups wildly dangling about my\r\nshins.  Even when I was in proper position and carefully balanced upon\r\nthe balls of my feet, there was no comfort in it, on account of my\r\nnervous dread that they were going to slip one way or the other in a\r\nmoment.  But the subject is too exasperating to write about.\r\n\r\nA mile and a half from town, I came to a grove of tall cocoanut trees,\r\nwith clean, branchless stems reaching straight up sixty or seventy feet\r\nand topped with a spray of green foliage sheltering clusters of\r\ncocoa-nuts--not more picturesque than a forest of collossal ragged\r\nparasols, with bunches of magnified grapes under them, would be.\r\n\r\nI once heard a gouty northern invalid say that a cocoanut tree might be\r\npoetical, possibly it was; but it looked like a feather-duster struck by\r\nlightning.  I think that describes it better than a picture--and yet,\r\nwithout any question, there is something fascinating about a cocoa-nut\r\ntree--and graceful, too.\r\n\r\nAbout a dozen cottages, some frame and the others of native grass,\r\nnestled sleepily in the shade here and there.  The grass cabins are of a\r\ngrayish color, are shaped much like our own cottages, only with higher\r\nand steeper roofs usually, and are made of some kind of weed strongly\r\nbound together in bundles.  The roofs are very thick, and so are the\r\nwalls; the latter have square holes in them for windows.  At a little\r\ndistance these cabins have a furry appearance, as if they might be made\r\nof bear skins.  They are very cool and pleasant inside.  The King\'s flag\r\nwas flying from the roof of one of the cottages, and His Majesty was\r\nprobably within.  He owns the whole concern thereabouts, and passes his\r\ntime there frequently, on sultry days "laying off."  The spot is called\r\n"The King\'s Grove."\r\n\r\nNear by is an interesting ruin--the meagre remains of an ancient heathen\r\ntemple--a place where human sacrifices were offered up in those old\r\nbygone days when the simple child of nature, yielding momentarily to sin\r\nwhen sorely tempted, acknowledged his error when calm reflection had\r\nshown it him, and came forward with noble frankness and offered up his\r\ngrandmother as an atoning sacrifice--in those old days when the luckless\r\nsinner could keep on cleansing his conscience and achieving periodical\r\nhappiness as long as his relations held out; long, long before the\r\nmissionaries braved a thousand privations to come and make them\r\npermanently miserable by telling them how beautiful and how blissful a\r\nplace heaven is, and how nearly impossible it is to get there; and showed\r\nthe poor native how dreary a place perdition is and what unnecessarily\r\nliberal facilities there are for going to it; showed him how, in his\r\nignorance he had gone and fooled away all his kinfolks to no purpose;\r\nshowed him what rapture it is to work all day long for fifty cents to buy\r\nfood for next day with, as compared with fishing for pastime and lolling\r\nin the shade through eternal Summer, and eating of the bounty that nobody\r\nlabored to provide but Nature.  How sad it is to think of the multitudes\r\nwho have gone to their graves in this beautiful island and never knew\r\nthere was a hell!\r\n\r\nThis ancient temple was built of rough blocks of lava, and was simply a\r\nroofless inclosure a hundred and thirty feet long and seventy wide\r\n--nothing but naked walls, very thick, but not much higher than a man\'s\r\nhead.  They will last for ages no doubt, if left unmolested.  Its three\r\naltars and other sacred appurtenances have crumbled and passed away years\r\nago.  It is said that in the old times thousands of human beings were\r\nslaughtered here, in the presence of naked and howling savages.  If these\r\nmute stones could speak, what tales they could tell, what pictures they\r\ncould describe, of fettered victims writhing under the knife; of massed\r\nforms straining forward out of the gloom, with ferocious faces lit up by\r\nthe sacrificial fires; of the background of ghostly trees; of the dark\r\npyramid of Diamond Head standing sentinel over the uncanny scene, and the\r\npeaceful moon looking down upon it through rifts in the cloud-rack!\r\n\r\nWhen Kamehameha (pronounced Ka-may-ha-may-ah) the Great--who was a sort\r\nof a Napoleon in military genius and uniform success--invaded this island\r\nof Oahu three quarters of a century ago, and exterminated the army sent\r\nto oppose him, and took full and final possession of the country, he\r\nsearched out the dead body of the King of Oahu, and those of the\r\nprincipal chiefs, and impaled their heads on the walls of this temple.\r\n\r\nThose were savage times when this old slaughter-house was in its prime.\r\nThe King and the chiefs ruled the common herd with a rod of iron; made\r\nthem gather all the provisions the masters needed; build all the houses\r\nand temples; stand all the expenses, of whatever kind; take kicks and\r\ncuffs for thanks; drag out lives well flavored with misery, and then\r\nsuffer death for trifling offences or yield up their lives on the\r\nsacrificial altars to purchase favors from the gods for their hard\r\nrulers.  The missionaries have clothed them, educated them, broken up the\r\ntyrannous authority of their chiefs, and given them freedom and the right\r\nto enjoy whatever their hands and brains produce with equal laws for all,\r\nand punishment for all alike who transgress them.  The contrast is so\r\nstrong--the benefit conferred upon this people by the missionaries is so\r\nprominent, so palpable and so unquestionable, that the frankest\r\ncompliment I can pay them, and the best, is simply to point to the\r\ncondition of the Sandwich Islanders of Captain Cook\'s time, and their\r\ncondition to-day.\r\n\r\nTheir work speaks for itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV.\r\n\r\nBy and by, after a rugged climb, we halted on the summit of a hill which\r\ncommanded a far-reaching view.  The moon rose and flooded mountain and\r\nvalley and ocean with a mellow radiance, and out of the shadows of the\r\nfoliage the distant lights of Honolulu glinted like an encampment of\r\nfireflies.  The air was heavy with the fragrance of flowers.  The halt\r\nwas brief.--Gayly laughing and talking, the party galloped on, and I\r\nclung to the pommel and cantered after.  Presently we came to a place\r\nwhere no grass grew--a wide expanse of deep sand.  They said it was an\r\nold battle ground.  All around everywhere, not three feet apart, the\r\nbleached bones of men gleamed white in the moonlight.  We picked up a lot\r\nof them for mementoes.  I got quite a number of arm bones and leg bones\r\n--of great chiefs, may be, who had fought savagely in that fearful battle\r\nin the old days, when blood flowed like wine where we now stood--and wore\r\nthe choicest of them out on Oahu afterward, trying to make him go.  All\r\nsorts of bones could be found except skulls; but a citizen said,\r\nirreverently, that there had been an unusual number of "skull-hunters"\r\nthere lately--a species of sportsmen I had never heard of before.\r\n\r\nNothing whatever is known about this place--its story is a secret that\r\nwill never be revealed.  The oldest natives make no pretense of being\r\npossessed of its history.  They say these bones were here when they were\r\nchildren.  They were here when their grandfathers were children--but how\r\nthey came here, they can only conjecture.  Many people believe this spot\r\nto be an ancient battle-ground, and it is usual to call it so; and they\r\nbelieve that these skeletons have lain for ages just where their\r\nproprietors fell in the great fight.  Other people believe that\r\nKamehameha I.  fought his first battle here.  On this point, I have heard\r\na story, which may have been taken from one of the numerous books which\r\nhave been written concerning these islands--I do not know where the\r\nnarrator got it.  He said that when Kamehameha (who was at first merely a\r\nsubordinate chief on the island of Hawaii), landed here, he brought a\r\nlarge army with him, and encamped at Waikiki.  The Oahuans marched\r\nagainst him, and so confident were they of success that they readily\r\nacceded to a demand of their priests that they should draw a line where\r\nthese bones now lie, and take an oath that, if forced to retreat at all,\r\nthey would never retreat beyond this boundary.  The priests told them\r\nthat death and everlasting punishment would overtake any who violated the\r\noath, and the march was resumed.  Kamehameha drove them back step by\r\nstep; the priests fought in the front rank and exhorted them both by\r\nvoice and inspiriting example to remember their oath--to die, if need be,\r\nbut never cross the fatal line.  The struggle was manfully maintained,\r\nbut at last the chief priest fell, pierced to the heart with a spear, and\r\nthe unlucky omen fell like a blight upon the brave souls at his back;\r\nwith a triumphant shout the invaders pressed forward--the line was\r\ncrossed--the offended gods deserted the despairing army, and, accepting\r\nthe doom their perjury had brought upon them, they broke and fled over\r\nthe plain where Honolulu stands now--up the beautiful Nuuanu Valley\r\n--paused a moment, hemmed in by precipitous mountains on either hand and\r\nthe frightful precipice of the Pari in front, and then were driven over\r\n--a sheer plunge of six hundred feet!\r\n\r\nThe story is pretty enough, but Mr. Jarves\' excellent history says the\r\nOahuans were intrenched in Nuuanu Valley; that Kamehameha ousted them,\r\nrouted them, pursued them up the valley and drove them over the\r\nprecipice.  He makes no mention of our bone-yard at all in his book.\r\n\r\nImpressed by the profound silence and repose that rested over the\r\nbeautiful landscape, and being, as usual, in the rear, I gave voice to my\r\nthoughts.  I said:\r\n\r\n"What a picture is here slumbering in the solemn glory of the moon!  How\r\nstrong the rugged outlines of the dead volcano stand out against the\r\nclear sky!  What a snowy fringe marks the bursting of the surf over the\r\nlong, curved reef!  How calmly the dim city sleeps yonder in the plain!\r\nHow soft the shadows lie upon the stately mountains that border the\r\ndream-haunted Mauoa Valley!  What a grand pyramid of billowy clouds\r\ntowers above the storied Pari!  How the grim warriors of the past seem\r\nflocking in ghostly squadrons to their ancient battlefield again--how the\r\nwails of the dying well up from the--"\r\n\r\nAt this point the horse called Oahu sat down in the sand.  Sat down to\r\nlisten, I suppose.  Never mind what he heard, I stopped apostrophising\r\nand convinced him that I was not a man to allow contempt of Court on the\r\npart of a horse.  I broke the back-bone of a Chief over his rump and set\r\nout to join the cavalcade again.\r\n\r\nVery considerably fagged out we arrived in town at 9 o\'clock at night,\r\nmyself in the lead--for when my horse finally came to understand that he\r\nwas homeward bound and hadn\'t far to go, he turned his attention strictly\r\nto business.\r\n\r\nThis is a good time to drop in a paragraph of information.  There is no\r\nregular livery stable in Honolulu, or, indeed, in any part of the Kingdom\r\nof Hawaii; therefore unless you are acquainted with wealthy residents\r\n(who all have good horses), you must hire animals of the wretchedest\r\ndescription from the Kanakas.  (i.e.  natives.) Any horse you hire, even\r\nthough it be from a white man, is not often of much account, because it\r\nwill be brought in for you from some ranch, and has necessarily been\r\nleading a hard life.  If the Kanakas who have been caring for him\r\n(inveterate riders they are) have not ridden him half to death every day\r\nthemselves, you can depend upon it they have been doing the same thing by\r\nproxy, by clandestinely hiring him out.  At least, so I am informed.  The\r\nresult is, that no horse has a chance to eat, drink, rest, recuperate, or\r\nlook well or feel well, and so strangers go about the Islands mounted as\r\nI was to-day.\r\n\r\nIn hiring a horse from a Kanaka, you must have all your eyes about you,\r\nbecause you can rest satisfied that you are dealing with a shrewd\r\nunprincipled rascal.  You may leave your door open and your trunk\r\nunlocked as long as you please, and he will not meddle with your\r\nproperty; he has no important vices and no inclination to commit robbery\r\non a large scale; but if he can get ahead of you in the horse business,\r\nhe will take a genuine delight in doing it.  This traits is\r\ncharacteristic of horse jockeys, the world over, is it not?  He will\r\novercharge you if he can; he will hire you a fine-looking horse at night\r\n(anybody\'s--may be the King\'s, if the royal steed be in convenient view),\r\nand bring you the mate to my Oahu in the morning, and contend that it is\r\nthe same animal.  If you make trouble, he will get out by saying it was\r\nnot himself who made the bargain with you, but his brother, "who went out\r\nin the country this morning."  They have always got a "brother" to shift\r\nthe responsibility upon.  A victim said to one of these fellows one day:\r\n\r\n"But I know I hired the horse of you, because I noticed that scar on your\r\ncheek."\r\n\r\nThe reply was not bad: "Oh, yes--yes--my brother all same--we twins!"\r\n\r\nA friend of mine, J.  Smith, hired a horse yesterday, the Kanaka\r\nwarranting him to be in excellent condition.\r\n\r\nSmith had a saddle and blanket of his own, and he ordered the Kanaka to\r\nput these on the horse.  The Kanaka protested that he was perfectly\r\nwilling to trust the gentleman with the saddle that was already on the\r\nanimal, but Smith refused to use it.  The change was made; then Smith\r\nnoticed that the Kanaka had only changed the saddles, and had left the\r\noriginal blanket on the horse; he said he forgot to change the blankets,\r\nand so, to cut the bother short, Smith mounted and rode away.  The horse\r\nwent lame a mile from town, and afterward got to cutting up some\r\nextraordinary capers.  Smith got down and took off the saddle, but the\r\nblanket stuck fast to the horse--glued to a procession of raw places.\r\nThe Kanaka\'s mysterious conduct stood explained.\r\n\r\nAnother friend of mine bought a pretty good horse from a native, a day or\r\ntwo ago, after a tolerably thorough examination of the animal.  He\r\ndiscovered today that the horse was as blind as a bat, in one eye.  He\r\nmeant to have examined that eye, and came home with a general notion that\r\nhe had done it; but he remembers now that every time he made the attempt\r\nhis attention was called to something else by his victimizer.\r\n\r\nOne more instance, and then I will pass to something else.  I am informed\r\nthat when a certain Mr. L., a visiting stranger, was here, he bought a\r\npair of very respectable-looking match horses from a native.  They were\r\nin a little stable with a partition through the middle of it--one horse\r\nin each apartment.  Mr. L.  examined one of them critically through a\r\nwindow (the Kanaka\'s "brother" having gone to the country with the key),\r\nand then went around the house and examined the other through a window on\r\nthe other side.  He said it was the neatest match he had ever seen, and\r\npaid for the horses on the spot.  Whereupon the Kanaka departed to join\r\nhis brother in the country.  The fellow had shamefully swindled L.  There\r\nwas only one "match" horse, and he had examined his starboard side\r\nthrough one window and his port side through another!  I decline to\r\nbelieve this story, but I give it because it is worth something as a\r\nfanciful illustration of a fixed fact--namely, that the Kanaka\r\nhorse-jockey is fertile in invention and elastic in conscience.\r\n\r\nYou can buy a pretty good horse for forty or fifty dollars, and a good\r\nenough horse for all practical purposes for two dollars and a half.  I\r\nestimate "Oahu" to be worth somewhere in the neighborhood of thirty-five\r\ncents.  A good deal better animal than he is was sold here day before\r\nyesterday for a dollar and seventy-five cents, and sold again to-day for\r\ntwo dollars and twenty-five cents; Williams bought a handsome and lively\r\nlittle pony yesterday for ten dollars; and about the best common horse on\r\nthe island (and he is a really good one) sold yesterday, with Mexican\r\nsaddle and bridle, for seventy dollars--a horse which is well and widely\r\nknown, and greatly respected for his speed, good disposition and\r\neverlasting bottom.\r\n\r\nYou give your horse a little grain once a day; it comes from San\r\nFrancisco, and is worth about two cents a pound; and you give him as much\r\nhay as he wants; it is cut and brought to the market by natives, and is\r\nnot very good it is baled into long, round bundles, about the size of a\r\nlarge man; one of them is stuck by the middle on each end of a six foot\r\npole, and the Kanaka shoulders the pole and walks about the streets\r\nbetween the upright bales in search of customers.  These hay bales, thus\r\ncarried, have a general resemblance to a colossal capital \'H.\'\r\n\r\nThe hay-bundles cost twenty-five cents apiece, and one will last a horse\r\nabout a day.  You can get a horse for a song, a week\'s hay for another\r\nsong, and you can turn your animal loose among the luxuriant grass in\r\nyour neighbor\'s broad front yard without a song at all--you do it at\r\nmidnight, and stable the beast again before morning.  You have been at no\r\nexpense thus far, but when you come to buy a saddle and bridle they will\r\ncost you from twenty to thirty-five dollars.  You can hire a horse,\r\nsaddle and bridle at from seven to ten dollars a week, and the owner will\r\ntake care of them at his own expense.\r\n\r\nIt is time to close this day\'s record--bed time.  As I prepare for sleep,\r\na rich voice rises out of the still night, and, far as this ocean rock is\r\ntoward the ends of the earth, I recognize a familiar home air.  But the\r\nwords seem somewhat out of joint:\r\n\r\n\r\n"Waikiki lantoni oe Kaa hooly hooly wawhoo."\r\n\r\nTranslated, that means "When we were marching through Georgia."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI.\r\n\r\nPassing through the market place we saw that feature of Honolulu under\r\nits most favorable auspices--that is, in the full glory of Saturday\r\nafternoon, which is a festive day with the natives.  The native girls by\r\ntwos and threes and parties of a dozen, and sometimes in whole platoons\r\nand companies, went cantering up and down the neighboring streets astride\r\nof fleet but homely horses, and with their gaudy riding habits streaming\r\nlike banners behind them.  Such a troop of free and easy riders, in their\r\nnatural home, the saddle, makes a gay and graceful spectacle.  The riding\r\nhabit I speak of is simply a long, broad scarf, like a tavern table cloth\r\nbrilliantly colored, wrapped around the loins once, then apparently\r\npassed between the limbs and each end thrown backward over the same, and\r\nfloating and flapping behind on both sides beyond the horse\'s tail like a\r\ncouple of fancy flags; then, slipping the stirrup-irons between her toes,\r\nthe girl throws her chest for ward, sits up like a Major General and goes\r\nsweeping by like the wind.\r\n\r\nThe girls put on all the finery they can on Saturday afternoon--fine\r\nblack silk robes; flowing red ones that nearly put your eyes out; others\r\nas white as snow; still others that discount the rainbow; and they wear\r\ntheir hair in nets, and trim their jaunty hats with fresh flowers, and\r\nencircle their dusky throats with home-made necklaces of the brilliant\r\nvermillion-tinted blossom of the ohia; and they fill the markets and the\r\nadjacent street with their bright presences, and smell like a rag factory\r\non fire with their offensive cocoanut oil.\r\n\r\nOccasionally you see a heathen from the sunny isles away down in the\r\nSouth Seas, with his face and neck tatooed till he looks like the\r\ncustomary mendicant from Washoe who has been blown up in a mine.  Some\r\nare tattooed a dead blue color down to the upper lip--masked, as it were\r\n--leaving the natural light yellow skin of Micronesia unstained from\r\nthence down; some with broad marks drawn down from hair to neck, on both\r\nsides of the face, and a strip of the original yellow skin, two inches\r\nwide, down the center--a gridiron with a spoke broken out; and some with\r\nthe entire face discolored with the popular mortification tint, relieved\r\nonly by one or two thin, wavy threads of natural yellow running across\r\nthe face from ear to ear, and eyes twinkling out of this darkness, from\r\nunder shadowing hat-brims, like stars in the dark of the moon.\r\n\r\nMoving among the stirring crowds, you come to the poi merchants,\r\nsquatting in the shade on their hams, in true native fashion, and\r\nsurrounded by purchasers.  (The Sandwich Islanders always squat on their\r\nhams, and who knows but they may be the old original "ham sandwiches?"\r\nThe thought is pregnant with interest.) The poi looks like common flour\r\npaste, and is kept in large bowls formed of a species of gourd, and\r\ncapable of holding from one to three or four gallons.  Poi is the chief\r\narticle of food among the natives, and is prepared from the taro plant.\r\n\r\nThe taro root looks like a thick, or, if you please, a corpulent sweet\r\npotato, in shape, but is of a light purple color when boiled.  When\r\nboiled it answers as a passable substitute for bread.  The buck Kanakas\r\nbake it under ground, then mash it up well with a heavy lava pestle, mix\r\nwater with it until it becomes a paste, set it aside and let if ferment,\r\nand then it is poi--and an unseductive mixture it is, almost tasteless\r\nbefore it ferments and too sour for a luxury afterward.  But nothing is\r\nmore nutritious.  When solely used, however, it produces acrid humors, a\r\nfact which sufficiently accounts for the humorous character of the\r\nKanakas.  I think there must be as much of a knack in handling poi as\r\nthere is in eating with chopsticks.  The forefinger is thrust into the\r\nmess and stirred quickly round several times and drawn as quickly out,\r\nthickly coated, just as it it were poulticed; the head is thrown back,\r\nthe finger inserted in the mouth and the delicacy stripped off and\r\nswallowed--the eye closing gently, meanwhile, in a languid sort of\r\necstasy.  Many a different finger goes into the same bowl and many a\r\ndifferent kind of dirt and shade and quality of flavor is added to the\r\nvirtues of its contents.\r\n\r\nAround a small shanty was collected a crowd of natives buying the awa\r\nroot.  It is said that but for the use of this root the destruction of\r\nthe people in former times by certain imported diseases would have been\r\nfar greater than it was, and by others it is said that this is merely a\r\nfancy.  All agree that poi will rejuvenate a man who is used up and his\r\nvitality almost annihilated by hard drinking, and that in some kinds of\r\ndiseases it will restore health after all medicines have failed; but all\r\nare not willing to allow to the awa the virtues claimed for it.  The\r\nnatives manufacture an intoxicating drink from it which is fearful in its\r\neffects when persistently indulged in.  It covers the body with dry,\r\nwhite scales, inflames the eyes, and causes premature decripitude.\r\nAlthough the man before whose establishment we stopped has to pay a\r\nGovernment license of eight hundred dollars a year for the exclusive\r\nright to sell awa root, it is said that he makes a small fortune every\r\ntwelve-month; while saloon keepers, who pay a thousand dollars a year for\r\nthe privilege of retailing whiskey, etc., only make a bare living.\r\n\r\nWe found the fish market crowded; for the native is very fond of fish,\r\nand eats the article raw and alive!  Let us change the subject.\r\n\r\nIn old times here Saturday was a grand gala day indeed.  All the native\r\npopulation of the town forsook their labors, and those of the surrounding\r\ncountry journeyed to the city.  Then the white folks had to stay indoors,\r\nfor every street was so packed with charging cavaliers and cavalieresses\r\nthat it was next to impossible to thread one\'s way through the cavalcades\r\nwithout getting crippled.\r\n\r\nAt night they feasted and the girls danced the lascivious hula hula--a\r\ndance that is said to exhibit the very perfection of educated notion of\r\nlimb and arm, hand, head and body, and the exactest uniformity of\r\nmovement and accuracy of "time."  It was performed by a circle of girls\r\nwith no raiment on them to speak of, who went through an infinite variety\r\nof motions and figures without prompting, and yet so true was their\r\n"time," and in such perfect concert did they move that when they were\r\nplaced in a straight line, hands, arms, bodies, limbs and heads waved,\r\nswayed, gesticulated, bowed, stooped, whirled, squirmed, twisted and\r\nundulated as if they were part and parcel of a single individual; and it\r\nwas difficult to believe they were not moved in a body by some exquisite\r\npiece of mechanism.\r\n\r\nOf late years, however, Saturday has lost most of its quondam gala\r\nfeatures.  This weekly stampede of the natives interfered too much with\r\nlabor and the interests of the white folks, and by sticking in a law\r\nhere, and preaching a sermon there, and by various other means, they\r\ngradually broke it up.  The demoralizing hula hula was forbidden to be\r\nperformed, save at night, with closed doors, in presence of few\r\nspectators, and only by permission duly procured from the authorities and\r\nthe payment of ten dollars for the same.  There are few girls now-a-days\r\nable to dance this ancient national dance in the highest perfection of\r\nthe art.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries have christianized and educated all the natives.  They\r\nall belong to the Church, and there is not one of them, above the age of\r\neight years, but can read and write with facility in the native tongue.\r\nIt is the most universally educated race of people outside of China.\r\nThey have any quantity of books, printed in the Kanaka language, and all\r\nthe natives are fond of reading.  They are inveterate church-goers\r\n--nothing can keep them away.  All this ameliorating cultivation has at\r\nlast built up in the native women a profound respect for chastity--in\r\nother people.  Perhaps that is enough to say on that head.  The national\r\nsin will die out when the race does, but perhaps not earlier.--But\r\ndoubtless this purifying is not far off, when we reflect that contact\r\nwith civilization and the whites has reduced the native population from\r\nfour hundred thousand (Captain Cook\'s estimate,) to fifty-five thousand\r\nin something over eighty years!\r\n\r\nSociety is a queer medley in this notable missionary, whaling and\r\ngovernmental centre.  If you get into conversation with a stranger and\r\nexperience that natural desire to know what sort of ground you are\r\ntreading on by finding out what manner of man your stranger is, strike\r\nout boldly and address him as "Captain."  Watch him narrowly, and if you\r\nsee by his countenance that you are on the wrong tack, ask him where he\r\npreaches.  It is a safe bet that he is either a missionary or captain of\r\na whaler.  I am now personally acquainted with seventy-two captains and\r\nninety-six missionaries.  The captains and ministers form one-half of the\r\npopulation; the third fourth is composed of common Kanakas and mercantile\r\nforeigners and their families, and the final fourth is made up of high\r\nofficers of the Hawaiian Government.  And there are just about cats\r\nenough for three apiece all around.\r\n\r\nA solemn stranger met me in the suburbs the other day, and said:\r\n\r\n"Good morning, your reverence.  Preach in the stone church yonder, no\r\ndoubt?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t.  I\'m not a preacher."\r\n\r\n"Really, I beg your pardon, Captain.  I trust you had a good season.  How\r\nmuch oil"--\r\n\r\n"Oil?  What do you take me for?  I\'m not a whaler."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I beg a thousand pardons, your Excellency.\r\n\r\n"Major General in the household troops, no doubt?  Minister of the\r\nInterior, likely?  Secretary of war?  First Gentleman of the Bed-chamber?\r\nCommissioner of the Royal"--\r\n\r\n"Stuff!  I\'m no official.  I\'m not connected in any way with the\r\nGovernment."\r\n\r\n"Bless my life!  Then, who the mischief are you?  what the mischief are\r\nyou?  and how the mischief did you get here, and where in thunder did you\r\ncome from?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m only a private personage--an unassuming stranger--lately arrived\r\nfrom America."\r\n\r\n"No?  Not a missionary!  Not a whaler!  not a member of his Majesty\'s\r\nGovernment!  not even Secretary of the Navy!  Ah, Heaven!  it is too\r\nblissful to be true; alas, I do but dream.  And yet that noble, honest\r\ncountenance--those oblique, ingenuous eyes--that massive head, incapable\r\nof--of--anything; your hand; give me your hand, bright waif.  Excuse\r\nthese tears.  For sixteen weary years I have yearned for a moment like\r\nthis, and"--\r\n\r\nHere his feelings were too much for him, and he swooned away.  I pitied\r\nthis poor creature from the bottom of my heart.  I was deeply moved.  I\r\nshed a few tears on him and kissed him for his mother.  I then took what\r\nsmall change he had and "shoved".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII.\r\n\r\nI still quote from my journal:\r\n\r\nI found the national Legislature to consist of half a dozen white men and\r\nsome thirty or forty natives.  It was a dark assemblage.  The nobles and\r\nMinisters (about a dozen of them altogether) occupied the extreme left of\r\nthe hall, with David Kalakaua (the King\'s Chamberlain) and Prince William\r\nat the head.  The President of the Assembly, His Royal Highness M.\r\nKekuanaoa, [Kekuanaoa is not of the blood royal.  He derives his princely\r\nrank from his wife, who was a daughter of Kamehameha the Great.  Under\r\nother monarchies the male line takes precedence of the female in tracing\r\ngenealogies, but here the opposite is the case--the female line takes\r\nprecedence.  Their reason for this is exceedingly sensible, and I\r\nrecommend it to the aristocracy of Europe: They say it is easy to know\r\nwho a man\'s mother was, but, etc., etc.] and the Vice President (the\r\nlatter a white man,) sat in the pulpit, if I may so term it.\r\nThe President is the King\'s father.  He is an erect, strongly built,\r\nmassive featured, white-haired, tawny old gentleman of eighty years of\r\nage or thereabouts.  He was simply but well dressed, in a blue cloth coat\r\nand white vest, and white pantaloons, without spot, dust or blemish upon\r\nthem.  He bears himself with a calm, stately dignity, and is a man of\r\nnoble presence.  He was a young man and a distinguished warrior under\r\nthat terrific fighter, Kamehameha I., more than half a century ago.  A\r\nknowledge of his career suggested some such thought as this: "This man,\r\nnaked as the day he was born, and war-club and spear in hand, has charged\r\nat the head of a horde of savages against other hordes of savages more\r\nthan a generation and a half ago, and reveled in slaughter and carnage;\r\nhas worshipped wooden images on his devout knees; has seen hundreds of\r\nhis race offered up in heathen temples as sacrifices to wooden idols, at\r\na time when no missionary\'s foot had ever pressed this soil, and he had\r\nnever heard of the white man\'s God; has believed his enemy could secretly\r\npray him to death; has seen the day, in his childhood, when it was a\r\ncrime punishable by death for a man to eat with his wife, or for a\r\nplebeian to let his shadow fall upon the King--and now look at him; an\r\neducated Christian; neatly and handsomely dressed; a high-minded, elegant\r\ngentleman; a traveler, in some degree, and one who has been the honored\r\nguest of royalty in Europe; a man practiced in holding the reins of an\r\nenlightened government, and well versed in the politics of his country\r\nand in general, practical information.  Look at him, sitting there\r\npresiding over the deliberations of a legislative body, among whom are\r\nwhite men--a grave, dignified, statesmanlike personage, and as seemingly\r\nnatural and fitted to the place as if he had been born in it and had\r\nnever been out of it in his life time.  How the experiences of this old\r\nman\'s eventful life shame the cheap inventions of romance!"\r\n\r\nThe christianizing of the natives has hardly even weakened some of their\r\nbarbarian superstitions, much less destroyed them.  I have just referred\r\nto one of these.  It is still a popular belief that if your enemy can get\r\nhold of any article belonging to you he can get down on his knees over it\r\nand pray you to death.  Therefore many a native gives up and dies merely\r\nbecause he imagines that some enemy is putting him through a course of\r\ndamaging prayer.  This praying an individual to death seems absurd enough\r\nat a first glance, but then when we call to mind some of the pulpit\r\nefforts of certain of our own ministers the thing looks plausible.\r\n\r\nIn former times, among the Islanders, not only a plurality of wives was\r\ncustomary, but a plurality of husbands likewise.  Some native women of\r\nnoble rank had as many as six husbands.  A woman thus supplied did not\r\nreside with all her husbands at once, but lived several months with each\r\nin turn.  An understood sign hung at her door during these months.  When\r\nthe sign was taken down, it meant "NEXT."\r\n\r\nIn those days woman was rigidly taught to "know her place."  Her place\r\nwas to do all the work, take all the cuffs, provide all the food, and\r\ncontent herself with what was left after her lord had finished his\r\ndinner.  She was not only forbidden, by ancient law, and under penalty of\r\ndeath, to eat with her husband or enter a canoe, but was debarred, under\r\nthe same penalty, from eating bananas, pine-apples, oranges and other\r\nchoice fruits at any time or in any place.  She had to confine herself\r\npretty strictly to "poi" and hard work.  These poor ignorant heathen seem\r\nto have had a sort of groping idea of what came of woman eating fruit in\r\nthe garden of Eden, and they did not choose to take any more chances.\r\nBut the missionaries broke up this satisfactory arrangement of things.\r\nThey liberated woman and made her the equal of man.\r\n\r\nThe natives had a romantic fashion of burying some of their children\r\nalive when the family became larger than necessary.  The missionaries\r\ninterfered in this matter too, and stopped it.\r\n\r\nTo this day the natives are able to lie down and die whenever they want\r\nto, whether there is anything the matter with them or not.  If a Kanaka\r\ntakes a notion to die, that is the end of him; nobody can persuade him to\r\nhold on; all the doctors in the world could not save him.\r\n\r\nA luxury which they enjoy more than anything else, is a large funeral.\r\nIf a person wants to get rid of a troublesome native, it is only\r\nnecessary to promise him a fine funeral and name the hour and he will be\r\non hand to the minute--at least his remains will.\r\n\r\nAll the natives are Christians, now, but many of them still desert to the\r\nGreat Shark God for temporary succor in time of trouble.  An irruption of\r\nthe great volcano of Kilauea, or an earthquake, always brings a deal of\r\nlatent loyalty to the Great Shark God to the surface.  It is common\r\nreport that the King, educated, cultivated and refined Christian\r\ngentleman as he undoubtedly is, still turns to the idols of his fathers\r\nfor help when disaster threatens.  A planter caught a shark, and one of\r\nhis christianized natives testified his emancipation from the thrall of\r\nancient superstition by assisting to dissect the shark after a fashion\r\nforbidden by his abandoned creed.  But remorse shortly began to torture\r\nhim.  He grew moody and sought solitude; brooded over his sin, refused\r\nfood, and finally said he must die and ought to die, for he had sinned\r\nagainst the Great Shark God and could never know peace any more.  He was\r\nproof against persuasion and ridicule, and in the course of a day or two\r\ntook to his bed and died, although he showed no symptom of disease.\r\nHis young daughter followed his lead and suffered a like fate within the\r\nweek.  Superstition is ingrained in the native blood and bone and it is\r\nonly natural that it should crop out in time of distress.  Wherever one\r\ngoes in the Islands, he will find small piles of stones by the wayside,\r\ncovered with leafy offerings, placed there by the natives to appease evil\r\nspirits or honor local deities belonging to the mythology of former days.\r\n\r\nIn the rural districts of any of the Islands, the traveler hourly comes\r\nupon parties of dusky maidens bathing in the streams or in the sea\r\nwithout any clothing on and exhibiting no very intemperate zeal in the\r\nmatter of hiding their nakedness.  When the missionaries first took up\r\ntheir residence in Honolulu, the native women would pay their families\r\nfrequent friendly visits, day by day, not even clothed with a blush.\r\nIt was found a hard matter to convince them that this was rather\r\nindelicate.  Finally the missionaries provided them with long, loose\r\ncalico robes, and that ended the difficulty--for the women would troop\r\nthrough the town, stark naked, with their robes folded under their arms,\r\nmarch to the missionary houses and then  proceed to dress!--The natives\r\nsoon manifested a strong proclivity for clothing, but it was shortly\r\napparent that they only wanted it for grandeur.  The missionaries\r\nimported a quantity of hats, bonnets, and other male and female wearing\r\napparel, instituted a general distribution, and begged the people not to\r\ncome to church naked, next Sunday, as usual.  And they did not; but the\r\nnational spirit of unselfishness led them to divide up with neighbors who\r\nwere not at the distribution, and next Sabbath the poor preachers could\r\nhardly keep countenance before their vast congregations.  In the midst of\r\nthe reading of a hymn a brown, stately dame would sweep up the aisle with\r\na world of airs, with nothing in the world on but a "stovepipe" hat and a\r\npair of cheap gloves; another dame would follow, tricked out in a man\'s\r\nshirt, and nothing else; another one would enter with a flourish, with\r\nsimply the sleeves of a bright calico dress tied around her waist and the\r\nrest of the garment dragging behind like a peacock\'s tail off duty; a\r\nstately "buck" Kanaka would stalk in with a woman\'s bonnet on, wrong side\r\nbefore--only this, and nothing more; after him would stride his fellow,\r\nwith the legs of a pair of pantaloons tied around his neck, the rest of\r\nhis person untrammeled; in his rear would come another gentleman simply\r\ngotten up in a fiery neck-tie and a striped vest.\r\n\r\nThe poor creatures were beaming with complacency and wholly unconscious\r\nof any absurdity in their appearance.  They gazed at each other with\r\nhappy admiration, and it was plain to see that the young girls were\r\ntaking note of what each other had on, as naturally as if they had always\r\nlived in a land of Bibles and knew what churches were made for; here was\r\nthe evidence of a dawning civilization.  The spectacle which the\r\ncongregation presented was so extraordinary and withal so moving, that\r\nthe missionaries found it difficult to keep to the text and go on with\r\nthe services; and by and by when the simple children of the sun began a\r\ngeneral swapping of garments in open meeting and produced some\r\nirresistibly grotesque effects in the course of re-dressing, there was\r\nnothing for it but to cut the thing short with the benediction and\r\ndismiss the fantastic assemblage.\r\n\r\nIn our country, children play "keep house;" and in the same high-sounding\r\nbut miniature way the grown folk here, with the poor little material of\r\nslender territory and meagre population, play "empire."  There is his\r\nroyal Majesty the King, with a New York detective\'s income of thirty or\r\nthirty-five thousand dollars a year from the "royal civil list" and the\r\n"royal domain."  He lives in a two-story frame "palace."\r\n\r\nAnd there is the "royal family"--the customary hive of royal brothers,\r\nsisters, cousins and other noble drones and vagrants usual to monarchy,\r\n--all with a spoon in the national pap-dish, and all bearing such titles as\r\nhis or her Royal Highness the Prince or Princess So-and-so.  Few of them\r\ncan carry their royal splendors far enough to ride in carriages, however;\r\nthey sport the economical Kanaka horse or "hoof it" with the plebeians.\r\n\r\nThen there is his Excellency the "royal Chamberlain"--a sinecure, for his\r\nmajesty dresses himself with his own hands, except when he is ruralizing\r\nat Waikiki and then he requires no dressing.\r\n\r\nNext we have his Excellency the Commander-in-chief of the Household\r\nTroops, whose forces consist of about the number of soldiers usually\r\nplaced under a corporal in other lands.\r\n\r\nNext comes the royal Steward and the Grand Equerry in Waiting--high\r\ndignitaries with modest salaries and little to do.\r\n\r\nThen we have his Excellency the First Gentleman of the Bed-chamber--an\r\noffice as easy as it is magnificent.\r\n\r\nNext we come to his Excellency the Prime Minister, a renegade American\r\nfrom New Hampshire, all jaw, vanity, bombast and ignorance, a lawyer of\r\n"shyster" calibre, a fraud by nature, a humble worshipper of the sceptre\r\nabove him, a reptile never tired of sneering at the land of his birth or\r\nglorifying the ten-acre kingdom that has adopted him--salary, $4,000 a\r\nyear, vast consequence, and no perquisites.\r\n\r\nThen we have his Excellency the Imperial Minister of Finance, who handles\r\na million dollars of public money a year, sends in his annual "budget"\r\nwith great ceremony, talks prodigiously of "finance," suggests imposing\r\nschemes for paying off the "national debt" (of $150,000,) and does it all\r\nfor $4,000 a year and unimaginable glory.\r\n\r\nNext we have his Excellency the Minister of War, who holds sway over the\r\nroyal armies--they consist of two hundred and thirty uniformed Kanakas,\r\nmostly Brigadier Generals, and if the country ever gets into trouble with\r\na foreign power we shall probably hear from them.  I knew an American\r\nwhose copper-plate visiting card bore this impressive legend:\r\n"Lieutenant-Colonel in the Royal Infantry."  To say that he was proud of\r\nthis distinction is stating it but tamely.  The Minister of War has also\r\nin his charge some venerable swivels on Punch-Bowl Hill wherewith royal\r\nsalutes are fired when foreign vessels of war enter the port.\r\n\r\nNext comes his Excellency the Minister of the Navy--a nabob who rules the\r\n"royal fleet," (a steam-tug and a sixty-ton schooner.)\r\n\r\nAnd next comes his Grace the Lord Bishop of Honolulu, the chief dignitary\r\nof the "Established Church"--for when the American Presbyterian\r\nmissionaries had completed the reduction of the nation to a compact\r\ncondition of Christianity, native royalty stepped in and erected the\r\ngrand dignity of an "Established (Episcopal) Church" over it, and\r\nimported a cheap ready-made Bishop from England to take charge.  The\r\nchagrin of the missionaries has never been comprehensively expressed, to\r\nthis day, profanity not being admissible.\r\n\r\nNext comes his Excellency the Minister of Public Instruction.\r\n\r\nNext, their Excellencies the Governors of Oahu, Hawaii, etc., and after\r\nthem a string of High Sheriffs and other small fry too numerous for\r\ncomputation.\r\n\r\nThen there are their Excellencies the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary of his Imperial Majesty the Emperor of the French; her\r\nBritish Majesty\'s Minister; the Minister Resident, of the United States;\r\nand some six or eight representatives of other foreign nations, all with\r\nsounding titles, imposing dignity and prodigious but economical state.\r\n\r\nImagine all this grandeur in a play-house "kingdom" whose population\r\nfalls absolutely short of sixty thousand souls!\r\n\r\nThe people are so accustomed to nine-jointed titles and colossal magnates\r\nthat a foreign prince makes very little more stir in Honolulu than a\r\nWestern Congressman does in New York.\r\n\r\nAnd let it be borne in mind that there is a strictly defined "court\r\ncostume" of so "stunning" a nature that it would make the clown in a\r\ncircus look tame and commonplace by comparison; and each Hawaiian\r\nofficial dignitary has a gorgeous vari-colored, gold-laced uniform\r\npeculiar to his office--no two of them are alike, and it is hard to tell\r\nwhich one is the "loudest."  The King had a "drawing-room" at stated\r\nintervals, like other monarchs, and when these varied uniforms congregate\r\nthere--weak-eyed people have to contemplate the spectacle through smoked\r\nglass.  Is there not a gratifying contrast between this latter-day\r\nexhibition and the one the ancestors of some of these magnates afforded\r\nthe missionaries the Sunday after the old-time distribution of clothing?\r\nBehold what religion and civilization have wrought!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\r\n\r\nWhile I was in Honolulu I witnessed the ceremonious funeral of the King\'s\r\nsister, her Royal Highness the Princess Victoria.  According to the royal\r\ncustom, the remains had lain in state at the palace thirty days, watched\r\nday and night by a guard of honor.  And during all that time a great\r\nmultitude of natives from the several islands had kept the palace grounds\r\nwell crowded and had made the place a pandemonium every night with their\r\nhowlings and wailings, beating of tom-toms and dancing of the (at other\r\ntimes) forbidden "hula-hula" by half-clad maidens to the music of songs\r\nof questionable decency chanted in honor of the deceased.  The printed\r\nprogramme of the funeral procession interested me at the time; and after\r\nwhat I have just said of Hawaiian grandiloquence in the matter of\r\n"playing empire," I am persuaded that a perusal of it may interest the\r\nreader:\r\n\r\n      After reading the long list of dignitaries, etc., and remembering\r\n      the sparseness of the population, one is almost inclined to wonder\r\n      where the material for that portion of the procession devoted to\r\n      "Hawaiian Population Generally" is going to be procured:\r\n\r\nUndertaker.\r\nRoyal School.

The coffin was\r\n      borne through the door of the mausoleum, followed by the King and\r\n      his chiefs, the great officers of the kingdom, foreign Consuls,\r\n      Embassadors and distinguished guests (Burlingame and General Van\r\n      Valkenburgh).  Several of the kahilis were then fastened to a\r\n      frame-work in front of the tomb, there to remain until they decay\r\n      and fall to pieces, or, forestalling this, until another scion of\r\n      royalty dies.  At this point of the proceedings the multitude set\r\n      up such a heart-broken wailing as I hope never to hear again.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers fired three volleys of musketry--the wailing being\r\npreviously silenced to permit of the guns being heard.  His Highness\r\nPrince William, in a showy military uniform (the "true prince," this\r\n--scion of the house over-thrown by the present dynasty--he was formerly\r\nbetrothed to the Princess but was not allowed to marry her), stood guard\r\nand paced back and forth within the door.  The privileged few who\r\nfollowed the coffin into the mausoleum remained sometime, but the King\r\nsoon came out and stood in the door and near one side of it.  A stranger\r\ncould have guessed his rank (although he was so simply and\r\nunpretentiously dressed) by the profound deference paid him by all\r\npersons in his vicinity; by seeing his high officers receive his quiet\r\norders and suggestions with bowed and uncovered heads; and by observing\r\nhow careful those persons who came out of the mausoleum were to avoid\r\n"crowding" him (although there was room enough in the doorway for a wagon\r\nto pass, for that matter); how respectfully they edged out sideways,\r\nscraping their backs against the wall and always presenting a front view\r\nof their persons to his Majesty, and never putting their hats on until\r\nthey were well out of the royal presence.\r\n\r\nHe was dressed entirely in black--dress-coat and silk hat--and looked\r\nrather democratic in the midst of the showy uniforms about him.  On his\r\nbreast he wore a large gold star, which was half hidden by the lapel of\r\nhis coat.  He remained at the door a half hour, and occasionally gave an\r\norder to the men who were erecting the kahilis [Ranks of long-handled\r\nmops made of gaudy feathers--sacred to royalty.  They are stuck in the\r\nground around the tomb and left there.]  before the tomb.  He had the\r\ngood taste to make one of them substitute black crape for the ordinary\r\nhempen rope he was about to tie one of them to the frame-work with.\r\nFinally he entered his carriage and drove away, and the populace shortly\r\nbegan to drop into his wake.  While he was in view there was but one man\r\nwho attracted more attention than himself, and that was Harris (the\r\nYankee Prime Minister).  This feeble personage had crape enough around\r\nhis hat to express the grief of an entire nation, and as usual he\r\nneglected no opportunity of making himself conspicuous and exciting the\r\nadmiration of the simple Kanakas.  Oh! noble ambition of this modern\r\nRichelieu!\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to contrast the funeral ceremonies of the Princess\r\nVictoria with those of her noted ancestor Kamehameha the Conqueror, who\r\ndied fifty years ago--in 1819, the year before the first missionaries\r\ncame.\r\n\r\n      "On the 8th of May, 1819, at the age of sixty-six, he died, as he\r\n      had lived, in the faith of his country.  It was his misfortune not\r\n      to have come in contact with men who could have rightly influenced\r\n      his religious aspirations.  Judged by his advantages and compared\r\n      with the most eminent of his countrymen he may be justly styled not\r\n      only great, but good.  To this day his memory warms the heart and\r\n      elevates the national feelings of Hawaiians.  They are proud of\r\n      their old warrior King; they love his name; his deeds form their\r\n      historical age; and an enthusiasm everywhere prevails, shared even\r\n      by foreigners who knew his worth, that constitutes the firmest\r\n      pillar of the throne of his dynasty.\r\n\r\n      "In lieu of human victims (the custom of that age), a sacrifice of\r\n      three hundred dogs attended his obsequies--no mean holocaust when\r\n      their national value and the estimation in which they were held are\r\n      considered.  The bones of Kamehameha, after being kept for a while,\r\n      were so carefully concealed that all knowledge of their final\r\n      resting place is now lost.  There was a proverb current among the\r\n      common people that the bones of a cruel King could not be hid; they\r\n      made fish-hooks and arrows of them, upon which, in using them, they\r\n      vented their abhorrence of his memory in bitter execrations."\r\n\r\nThe account of the circumstances of his death, as written by the native\r\nhistorians, is full of minute detail, but there is scarcely a line of it\r\nwhich does not mention or illustrate some by-gone custom of the country.\r\nIn this respect it is the most comprehensive document I have yet met\r\nwith.  I will quote it entire:\r\n\r\n      "When Kamehameha was dangerously sick, and the priests were unable\r\n      to cure him, they said: \'Be of good courage and build a house for\r\n      the god\' (his own private god or idol), that thou mayest recover.\'\r\n      The chiefs corroborated this advice of the priests, and a place of\r\n      worship was prepared for Kukailimoku, and consecrated in the\r\n      evening.  They proposed also to the King, with a view to prolong his\r\n      life, that human victims should be sacrificed to his deity; upon\r\n      which the greater part of the people absconded through fear of\r\n      death, and concealed themselves in hiding places till the tabu [Tabu\r\n      (pronounced tah-boo,) means prohibition (we have borrowed it,) or\r\n      sacred.  The tabu was sometimes permanent, sometimes temporary; and\r\n      the person or thing placed under tabu was for the time being sacred\r\n      to the purpose for which it was set apart.  In the above case the\r\n      victims selected under the tabu would be sacred to the sacrifice]\r\n      in which destruction impended, was past.  It is doubtful whether\r\n      Kamehameha approved of the plan of the chiefs and priests to\r\n      sacrifice men, as he was known to say, \'The men are sacred for the\r\n      King;\' meaning that they were for the service of his successor.\r\n      This information was derived from Liholiho, his son.\r\n\r\n      "After this, his sickness increased to such a degree that he had not\r\n      strength to turn himself in his bed.  When another season,\r\n      consecrated for worship at the new temple (heiau) arrived, he said\r\n      to his son, Liholiho, \'Go thou and make supplication to thy god; I\r\n      am not able to go, and will offer my prayers at home.\'  When his\r\n      devotions to his feathered god, Kukailimoku, were concluded, a\r\n      certain religiously disposed individual, who had a bird god,\r\n      suggested to the King that through its influence his sickness might\r\n      be removed.  The name of this god was Pua; its body was made of a\r\n      bird, now eaten by the Hawaiians, and called in their language alae.\r\n      Kamehameha was willing that a trial should be made, and two houses\r\n      were constructed to facilitate the experiment; but while dwelling in\r\n      them he became so very weak as not to receive food.  After lying\r\n      there three days, his wives, children and chiefs, perceiving that he\r\n      was very low, returned him to his own house.  In the evening he was\r\n      carried to the eating house,  where he took a little food in his\r\n      mouth which he did not swallow; also a cup of water.  The chiefs\r\n      requested him to give them his counsel; but he made no reply, and\r\n      was carried back to the dwelling house; but when near midnight--ten\r\n      o\'clock, perhaps--he was carried again to the place to eat; but, as\r\n      before, he merely tasted of what was presented to him.  Then\r\n      Kaikioewa addressed him thus: \'Here we all are, your younger\r\n      brethren, your son Liholiho and your foreigner; impart to us your\r\n      dying charge, that Liholiho and Kaahumanu may hear.\' Then Kamehameha\r\n      inquired, \'What do you say?\' Kaikioewa repeated, \'Your counsels for\r\n      us.\'\r\n\r\n      "He then said, \'Move on in my good way and--.\' He could proceed no\r\n      further.  The foreigner, Mr. Young, embraced and kissed him.\r\n      Hoapili also embraced him, whispering something in his ear, after\r\n      which he was taken back to the house.  About twelve he was carried\r\n      once more to the house for eating, into which his head entered,\r\n      while his body was in the dwelling house immediately adjoining.  It\r\n      should be remarked that this frequent carrying of a sick chief from\r\n      one house to another resulted from the tabu system, then in force.\r\n      There were at that time six houses (huts) connected with an\r\n      establishment--one was for worship, one for the men to eat in, an\r\n      eating house for the women, a house to sleep in, a house in which to\r\n      manufacture kapa (native cloth) and one where, at certain intervals,\r\n      the women might dwell in seclusion.\r\n\r\n      "The sick was once more taken to his house, when he expired; this\r\n      was at two o\'clock, a circumstance from which Leleiohoku derived his\r\n      name.  As he breathed his last, Kalaimoku came to the eating house\r\n      to order those in it to go out.  There were two aged persons thus\r\n      directed to depart; one went, the other remained on account of love\r\n      to the King, by whom he had formerly been kindly sustained.  The\r\n      children also were sent away.  Then Kalaimoku came to the house, and\r\n      the chiefs had a consultation.  One of them spoke thus: \'This is my\r\n      thought--we will eat him raw. [This sounds suspicious, in view of\r\n      the fact that all Sandwich Island historians, white and black,\r\n      protest that cannibalism never existed in the islands.  However,\r\n      since they only proposed to "eat him raw" we "won\'t count that".\r\n      But it would certainly have been cannibalism if they had cooked\r\n      him.--M.  T.]  Kaahumanu (one of the dead King\'s widows) replied,\r\n      \'Perhaps his body is not at our disposal; that is more properly with\r\n      his successor.  Our part in him--his breath--has departed; his\r\n      remains will be disposed of by Liholiho.\'\r\n\r\n      "After this conversation the body was taken into the consecrated\r\n      house for the performance of the proper rites by the priest and the\r\n      new King.  The name of this ceremony is uko; and when the sacred hog\r\n      was baked the priest offered it to the dead body, and it became a\r\n      god, the King at the same time repeating the customary prayers.\r\n\r\n      "Then the priest, addressing himself to the King and chiefs, said:\r\n      \'I will now make known to you the rules to be observed respecting\r\n      persons to be sacrificed on the burial of this body.  If you obtain\r\n      one man before the corpse is removed, one will be sufficient; but\r\n      after it leaves this house four will be required.  If delayed until\r\n      we carry the corpse to the grave there must be ten; but after it is\r\n      deposited in the grave there must be fifteen.  To-morrow morning\r\n      there will be a tabu, and, if the sacrifice be delayed until that\r\n      time, forty men must die.\'\r\n\r\n      "Then the high priest, Hewahewa, inquired of the chiefs, \'Where\r\n      shall be the residence of King Liholiho?\'  They replied, \'Where,\r\n      indeed?  You, of all men, ought to know.\'  Then the priest observed,\r\n      \'There are two suitable places; one is Kau, the other is Kohala.\'\r\n      The chiefs preferred the latter, as it was more thickly inhabited.\r\n      The priest added, \'These are proper places for the King\'s residence;\r\n      but he must not remain in Kona, for it is polluted.\'  This was\r\n      agreed to.  It was now break of day.  As he was being carried to the\r\n      place of burial the people perceived that their King was dead, and\r\n      they wailed.  When the corpse was removed from the house to the\r\n      tomb, a distance of one chain, the procession was met by a certain\r\n      man who was ardently attached to the deceased.  He leaped upon the\r\n      chiefs who were carrying the King\'s body; he desired to die with him\r\n      on account of his love.  The chiefs drove him away.  He persisted in\r\n      making numerous attempts, which were unavailing.  Kalaimoka also had\r\n      it in his heart to die with him, but was prevented by Hookio.\r\n\r\n      "The morning following Kamehameha\'s death, Liholiho and his train\r\n      departed for Kohala, according to the suggestions of the priest, to\r\n      avoid the defilement occasioned by the dead.  At this time if a\r\n      chief died the land was polluted, and the heirs sought a residence\r\n      in another part of the country until the corpse was dissected and\r\n      the bones tied in a bundle, which being done, the season of\r\n      defilement terminated.  If the deceased were not a chief, the house\r\n      only was defiled which became pure again on the burial of the body.\r\n      Such were the laws on this subject.\r\n\r\n      "On the morning on which Liholiho sailed in his canoe for Kohala,\r\n      the chiefs and people mourned after their manner on occasion of a\r\n      chief\'s death, conducting themselves like madmen and like beasts.\r\n      Their conduct was such as to forbid description; The priests, also,\r\n      put into action the sorcery apparatus, that the person who had\r\n      prayed the King to death might die; for it was not believed that\r\n      Kamehameha\'s departure was the effect either of sickness or old age.\r\n      When the sorcerers set up by their fire-places sticks with a strip\r\n      of kapa flying at the top, the chief Keeaumoku, Kaahumaun\'s brother,\r\n      came in a state of intoxication and broke the flag-staff of the\r\n      sorcerers, from which it was inferred that Kaahumanu and her friends\r\n      had been instrumental in the King\'s death.  On this account they\r\n      were subjected to abuse."\r\n\r\nYou have the contrast, now, and a strange one it is.  This great Queen,\r\nKaahumanu, who was "subjected to abuse" during the frightful orgies that\r\nfollowed the King\'s death, in accordance with ancient custom, afterward\r\nbecame a devout Christian and a steadfast and powerful friend of the\r\nmissionaries.\r\n\r\nDogs were, and still are, reared and fattened for food, by the natives\r\n--hence the reference to their value in one of the above paragraphs.\r\n\r\nForty years ago it was the custom in the Islands to suspend all law for a\r\ncertain number of days after the death of a royal personage; and then a\r\nsaturnalia ensued which one may picture to himself after a fashion, but\r\nnot in the full horror of the reality.  The people shaved their heads,\r\nknocked out a tooth or two, plucked out an eye sometimes, cut, bruised,\r\nmutilated or burned their flesh, got drunk, burned each other\'s huts,\r\nmaimed or murdered one another according to the caprice of the moment,\r\nand both sexes gave themselves up to brutal and unbridled licentiousness.\r\n\r\nAnd after it all, came a torpor from which the nation slowly emerged\r\nbewildered and dazed, as if from a hideous half-remembered nightmare.\r\nThey were not the salt of the earth, those "gentle children of the sun."\r\n\r\nThe natives still keep up an old custom of theirs which cannot be\r\ncomforting to an invalid.  When they think a sick friend is going to die,\r\na couple of dozen neighbors surround his hut and keep up a deafening\r\nwailing night and day till he either dies or gets well.  No doubt this\r\narrangement has helped many a subject to a shroud before his appointed\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThey surround a hut and wail in the same heart-broken way when its\r\noccupant returns from a journey.  This is their dismal idea of a welcome.\r\nA very little of it would go a great way with most of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX.\r\n\r\nBound for Hawaii (a hundred and fifty miles distant,) to visit the great\r\nvolcano and behold the other notable things which distinguish that island\r\nabove the remainder of the group, we sailed from Honolulu on a certain\r\nSaturday afternoon, in the good schooner Boomerang.\r\n\r\nThe Boomerang was about as long as two street cars, and about as wide as\r\none.  She was so small (though she was larger than the majority of the\r\ninter-island coasters) that when I stood on her deck I felt but little\r\nsmaller than the Colossus of Rhodes must have felt when he had a\r\nman-of-war under him.  I could reach the water when she lay over under a\r\nstrong breeze.  When the Captain and my comrade (a Mr. Billings), myself\r\nand four other persons were all assembled on the little after portion of\r\nthe deck which is sacred to the cabin passengers, it was full--there was\r\nnot room for any more quality folks.  Another section of the deck, twice\r\nas large as ours, was full of natives of both sexes, with their customary\r\ndogs, mats, blankets, pipes, calabashes of poi, fleas, and other luxuries\r\nand baggage of minor importance.  As soon as we set sail the natives all\r\nlay down on the deck as thick as negroes in a slave-pen, and smoked,\r\nconversed, and spit on each other, and were truly sociable.\r\n\r\nThe little low-ceiled cabin below was rather larger than a hearse, and as\r\ndark as a vault.  It had two coffins on each side--I mean two bunks.\r\nA small table, capable of accommodating three persons at dinner, stood\r\nagainst the forward bulkhead, and over it hung the dingiest whale oil\r\nlantern that ever peopled the obscurity of a dungeon with ghostly shapes.\r\nThe floor room unoccupied was not extensive.  One might swing a cat in\r\nit, perhaps, but not a long cat.  The hold forward of the bulkhead had\r\nbut little freight in it, and from morning till night a portly old\r\nrooster, with a voice like Baalam\'s ass, and the same disposition to use\r\nit, strutted up and down in that part of the vessel and crowed.  He\r\nusually took dinner at six o\'clock, and then, after an hour devoted to\r\nmeditation, he mounted a barrel and crowed a good part of the night.\r\nHe got hoarser all the time, but he scorned to allow any personal\r\nconsideration to interfere with his duty, and kept up his labors in\r\ndefiance of threatened diphtheria.\r\n\r\nSleeping was out of the question when he was on watch.  He was a source\r\nof genuine aggravation and annoyance.  It was worse than useless to shout\r\nat him or apply offensive epithets to him--he only took these things for\r\napplause, and strained himself to make more noise.  Occasionally, during\r\nthe day, I threw potatoes at him through an aperture in the bulkhead, but\r\nhe only dodged and went on crowing.\r\n\r\nThe first night, as I lay in my coffin, idly watching the dim lamp\r\nswinging to the rolling of the ship, and snuffing the nauseous odors of\r\nbilge water, I felt something gallop over me.  I turned out promptly.\r\nHowever, I turned in again when I found it was only a rat.  Presently\r\nsomething galloped over me once more.  I knew it was not a rat this time,\r\nand I thought it might be a centipede, because the Captain had killed one\r\non deck in the afternoon.  I turned out.  The first glance at the pillow\r\nshowed me repulsive sentinel perched upon each end of it--cockroaches as\r\nlarge as peach leaves--fellows with long, quivering antennae and fiery,\r\nmalignant eyes.  They were grating their teeth like tobacco worms, and\r\nappeared to be dissatisfied about something.  I had often heard that\r\nthese reptiles were in the habit of eating off sleeping sailors\' toe\r\nnails down to the quick, and I would not get in the bunk any more.  I lay\r\ndown on the floor.  But a rat came and bothered me, and shortly afterward\r\na procession of cockroaches arrived and camped in my hair.  In a few\r\nmoments the rooster was crowing with uncommon spirit and a party of fleas\r\nwere throwing double somersaults about my person in the wildest disorder,\r\nand taking a bite every time they struck.  I was beginning to feel really\r\nannoyed.  I got up and put my clothes on and went on deck.\r\n\r\nThe above is not overdrawn; it is a truthful sketch of inter-island\r\nschooner life.  There is no such thing as keeping a vessel in elegant\r\ncondition, when she carries molasses and Kanakas.\r\n\r\nIt was compensation for my sufferings to come unexpectedly upon so\r\nbeautiful a scene as met my eye--to step suddenly out of the sepulchral\r\ngloom of the cabin and stand under the strong light of the moon--in the\r\ncentre, as it were, of a glittering sea of liquid silver--to see the\r\nbroad sails straining in the gale, the ship heeled over on her side, the\r\nangry foam hissing past her lee bulwarks, and sparkling sheets of spray\r\ndashing high over her bows and raining upon her decks; to brace myself\r\nand hang fast to the first object that presented itself, with hat jammed\r\ndown and coat tails whipping in the breeze, and feel that exhilaration\r\nthat thrills in one\'s hair and quivers down his back bone when he knows\r\nthat every inch of canvas is drawing and the vessel cleaving through the\r\nwaves at her utmost speed.  There was no darkness, no dimness, no\r\nobscurity there.  All was brightness, every object was vividly defined.\r\nEvery prostrate Kanaka; every coil of rope; every calabash of poi; every\r\npuppy; every seam in the flooring; every bolthead; every object; however\r\nminute, showed sharp and distinct in its every outline; and the shadow of\r\nthe broad mainsail lay black as a pall upon the deck, leaving Billings\'s\r\nwhite upturned face glorified and his body in a total eclipse.\r\nMonday morning we were close to the island of Hawaii.  Two of its high\r\nmountains were in view--Mauna Loa and Hualaiai.\r\n\r\nThe latter is an imposing peak, but being only ten thousand feet high is\r\nseldom mentioned or heard of.  Mauna Loa is said to be sixteen thousand\r\nfeet high.  The rays of glittering snow and ice, that clasped its summit\r\nlike a claw, looked refreshing when viewed from the blistering climate we\r\nwere in.  One could stand on that mountain (wrapped up in blankets and\r\nfurs to keep warm), and while he nibbled a snowball or an icicle to\r\nquench his thirst he could look down the long sweep of its sides and see\r\nspots where plants are growing that grow only where the bitter cold of\r\nWinter prevails; lower down he could see sections devoted to production\r\nthat thrive in the temperate zone alone; and at the bottom of the\r\nmountain he could see the home of the tufted cocoa-palms and other\r\nspecies of vegetation that grow only in the sultry atmosphere of eternal\r\nSummer.  He could see all the climes of the world at a single glance of\r\nthe eye, and that glance would only pass over a distance of four or five\r\nmiles as the bird flies!\r\n\r\nBy and by we took boat and went ashore at Kailua, designing to ride\r\nhorseback through the pleasant orange and coffee region of Kona, and\r\nrejoin the vessel at a point some leagues distant.  This journey is well\r\nworth taking.  The trail passes along on high ground--say a thousand feet\r\nabove sea level--and usually about a mile distant from the ocean, which\r\nis always in sight, save that occasionally you find yourself buried in\r\nthe forest in the midst of a rank tropical vegetation and a dense growth\r\nof trees, whose great bows overarch the road and shut out sun and sea and\r\neverything, and leave you in a dim, shady tunnel, haunted with invisible\r\nsinging birds and fragrant with the odor of flowers.  It was pleasant to\r\nride occasionally in the warm sun, and feast the eye upon the\r\never-changing panorama of the forest (beyond and below us), with its many\r\ntints, its softened lights and shadows, its billowy undulations sweeping\r\ngently down from the mountain to the sea.  It was pleasant also, at\r\nintervals, to leave the sultry sun and pass into the cool, green depths\r\nof this forest and indulge in sentimental reflections under the\r\ninspiration of its brooding twilight and its whispering foliage.\r\nWe rode through one orange grove that had ten thousand tree in it!\r\nThey were all laden with fruit.\r\n\r\nAt one farmhouse we got some large peaches of excellent flavor.\r\nThis fruit, as a general thing, does not do well in the Sandwich Islands.\r\nIt takes a sort of almond shape, and is small and bitter.  It needs\r\nfrost, they say, and perhaps it does; if this be so, it will have a good\r\nopportunity to go on needing it, as it will not be likely to get it.\r\nThe trees from which the fine fruit I have spoken of, came, had been\r\nplanted and replanted sixteen times, and to this treatment the proprietor\r\nof the orchard attributed his-success.\r\n\r\nWe passed several sugar plantations--new ones and not very extensive.\r\nThe crops were, in most cases, third rattoons.  [NOTE.--The first crop is\r\ncalled "plant cane;" subsequent crops which spring from the original\r\nroots, without replanting, are called "rattoons."] Almost everywhere on\r\nthe island of Hawaii sugar-cane matures in twelve months, both rattoons\r\nand plant, and although it ought to be taken off as soon as it tassels,\r\nno doubt, it is not absolutely necessary to do it until about four months\r\nafterward.  In Kona, the average yield of an acre of ground is two tons\r\nof sugar, they say.  This is only a moderate yield for these islands, but\r\nwould be astounding for Louisiana and most other sugar growing countries.\r\nThe plantations in Kona being on pretty high ground--up among the light\r\nand frequent rains--no irrigation whatever is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX.\r\n\r\nWe stopped some time at one of the plantations, to rest ourselves and\r\nrefresh the horses.  We had a chatty conversation with several gentlemen\r\npresent; but there was one person, a middle aged man, with an absent look\r\nin his face, who simply glanced up, gave us good-day and lapsed again\r\ninto the meditations which our coming had interrupted.  The planters\r\nwhispered us not to mind him--crazy.  They said he was in the Islands for\r\nhis health; was a preacher; his home, Michigan.  They said that if he\r\nwoke up presently and fell to talking about a correspondence which he had\r\nsome time held with Mr. Greeley about a trifle of some kind, we must\r\nhumor him and listen with interest; and we must humor his fancy that this\r\ncorrespondence was the talk of the world.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to see that he was a gentle creature and that his madness had\r\nnothing vicious in it.  He looked pale, and a little worn, as if with\r\nperplexing thought and anxiety of mind.  He sat a long time, looking at\r\nthe floor, and at intervals muttering to himself and nodding his head\r\nacquiescingly or shaking it in mild protest.  He was lost in his thought,\r\nor in his memories.  We continued our talk with the planters, branching\r\nfrom subject to subject.  But at last the word "circumstance," casually\r\ndropped, in the course of conversation, attracted his attention and\r\nbrought an eager look into his countenance.  He faced about in his chair\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n"Circumstance?  What circumstance?  Ah, I know--I know too well.  So you\r\nhave heard of it too."  [With a sigh.] "Well, no matter--all the world\r\nhas heard of it.  All the world.  The whole world.  It is a large world,\r\ntoo, for a thing to travel so far in--now isn\'t it?  Yes, yes--the\r\nGreeley correspondence with Erickson has created the saddest and\r\nbitterest controversy on both sides of the ocean--and still they keep it\r\nup!  It makes us famous, but at what a sorrowful sacrifice!  I was so\r\nsorry when I heard that it had caused that bloody and distressful war\r\nover there in Italy.  It was little comfort to me, after so much\r\nbloodshed, to know that the victors sided with me, and the vanquished\r\nwith Greeley.--It is little comfort to know that Horace Greeley is\r\nresponsible for the battle of Sadowa, and not me.\r\n\r\n"Queen Victoria wrote me that she felt just as I did about it--she said\r\nthat as much as she was opposed to Greeley and the spirit he showed in\r\nthe correspondence with me, she would not have had Sadowa happen for\r\nhundreds of dollars.  I can show you her letter, if you would like to see\r\nit.  But gentlemen, much as you may think you know about that unhappy\r\ncorrespondence, you cannot know the straight of it till you hear it from\r\nmy lips.  It has always been garbled in the journals, and even in\r\nhistory.  Yes, even in history--think of it!  Let me--please let me, give\r\nyou the matter, exactly as it occurred.  I truly will not abuse your\r\nconfidence."\r\n\r\nThen he leaned forward, all interest, all earnestness, and told his\r\nstory--and told it appealingly, too, and yet in the simplest and most\r\nunpretentious way; indeed, in such a way as to suggest to one, all the\r\ntime, that this was a faithful, honorable witness, giving evidence in the\r\nsacred interest of justice, and under oath.  He said:\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Beazeley--Mrs. Jackson Beazeley, widow, of the village of\r\nCampbellton, Kansas,--wrote me about a matter which was near her heart\r\n--a matter which many might think trivial, but to her it was a thing of\r\ndeep concern.  I was living in Michigan, then--serving in the ministry.\r\nShe was, and is, an estimable woman--a woman to whom poverty and hardship\r\nhave proven incentives to industry, in place of discouragements.\r\nHer only treasure was her son William, a youth just verging upon manhood;\r\nreligious, amiable, and sincerely attached to agriculture.  He was the\r\nwidow\'s comfort and her pride.  And so, moved by her love for him, she\r\nwrote me about a matter, as I have said before, which lay near her heart\r\n--because it lay near her boy\'s.  She desired me to confer with\r\nMr. Greeley about turnips.  Turnips were the dream of her child\'s young\r\nambition.  While other youths were frittering away in frivolous\r\namusements the precious years of budding vigor which God had given them\r\nfor useful preparation, this boy was patiently enriching his mind with\r\ninformation concerning turnips.  The sentiment which he felt toward the\r\nturnip was akin to adoration.  He could not think of the turnip without\r\nemotion; he could not speak of it calmly; he could not contemplate it\r\nwithout exaltation.  He could not eat it without shedding tears.  All the\r\npoetry in his sensitive nature was in sympathy with the gracious\r\nvegetable.  With the earliest pipe of dawn he sought his patch, and when\r\nthe curtaining night drove him from it he shut himself up with his books\r\nand garnered statistics till sleep overcame him.  On rainy days he sat\r\nand talked hours together with his mother about turnips.  When company\r\ncame, he made it his loving duty to put aside everything else and\r\nconverse with them all the day long of his great joy in the turnip.\r\n\r\n"And yet, was this joy rounded and complete?  Was there no secret alloy of\r\nunhappiness in it?  Alas, there was.  There was a canker gnawing at his\r\nheart; the noblest inspiration of his soul eluded his endeavor--viz: he\r\ncould not make of the turnip a climbing vine.  Months went by; the bloom\r\nforsook his cheek, the fire faded out of his eye; sighings and\r\nabstraction usurped the place of smiles and cheerful converse.  But a\r\nwatchful eye noted these things and in time a motherly sympathy unsealed\r\nthe secret.  Hence the letter to me.  She pleaded for attention--she said\r\nher boy was dying by inches.\r\n\r\n"I was a stranger to Mr. Greeley, but what of that?  The matter was\r\nurgent.  I wrote and begged him to solve the difficult problem if\r\npossible and save the student\'s life.  My interest grew, until it partook\r\nof the anxiety of the mother.  I waited in much suspense.--At last the\r\nanswer came.\r\n\r\n"I found that I could not read it readily, the handwriting being\r\nunfamiliar and my emotions somewhat wrought up.  It seemed to refer in\r\npart to the boy\'s case, but chiefly to other and irrelevant matters--such\r\nas paving-stones, electricity, oysters, and something which I took to be\r\n\'absolution\' or \'agrarianism,\' I could not be certain which; still, these\r\nappeared to be simply casual mentions, nothing more; friendly in spirit,\r\nwithout doubt, but lacking the connection or coherence necessary to make\r\nthem useful.--I judged that my understanding was affected by my feelings,\r\nand so laid the letter away till morning.\r\n\r\n"In the morning I read it again, but with difficulty and uncertainty\r\nstill, for I had lost some little rest and my mental vision seemed\r\nclouded.  The note was more connected, now, but did not meet the\r\nemergency it was expected to meet.  It was too discursive.  It appeared\r\nto read as follows, though I was not certain of some of the words:\r\n\r\n      "Polygamy dissembles majesty; extracts redeem polarity; causes\r\n      hitherto exist.  Ovations pursue wisdom, or warts inherit and\r\n      condemn.  Boston, botany, cakes, folony undertakes, but who shall\r\n      allay?  We fear not.  Yrxwly,\r\n                               HEVACE EVEELOJ.\'\r\n\r\n"But there did not seem to be a word about turnips.  There seemed to be\r\nno suggestion as to how they might be made to grow like vines.  There was\r\nnot even a reference to the Beazeleys.  I slept upon the matter; I ate no\r\nsupper, neither any breakfast next morning.  So I resumed my work with a\r\nbrain refreshed, and was very hopeful.  Now the letter took a different\r\naspect-all save the signature, which latter I judged to be only a\r\nharmless affectation of Hebrew.  The epistle was necessarily from Mr.\r\nGreeley, for it bore the printed heading of The Tribune, and I had\r\nwritten to no one else there.  The letter, I say, had taken a different\r\naspect, but still its language was eccentric and avoided the issue.  It\r\nnow appeared to say:\r\n\r\n      "Bolivia extemporizes mackerel; borax esteems polygamy; sausages\r\n      wither in the east.  Creation perdu, is done; for woes inherent one\r\n      can damn.  Buttons, buttons, corks, geology underrates but we shall\r\n      allay.  My beer\'s out.  Yrxwly,\r\n                                         HEVACE EVEELOJ.\'\r\n\r\n"I was evidently overworked.  My comprehension was impaired.  Therefore I\r\ngave two days to recreation, and then returned to my task greatly\r\nrefreshed.  The letter now took this form:\r\n\r\n      "Poultices do sometimes choke swine; tulips reduce posterity; causes\r\n      leather to resist.  Our notions empower wisdom, her let\'s afford\r\n      while we can.  Butter but any cakes, fill any undertaker, we\'ll wean\r\n      him from his filly.  We feel hot.\r\n                                    Yrxwly, HEVACE EVEELOJ.\'\r\n\r\n"I was still not satisfied.  These generalities did not meet the\r\nquestion.  They were crisp, and vigorous, and delivered with a confidence\r\nthat almost compelled conviction; but at such a time as this, with a\r\nhuman life at stake, they seemed inappropriate, worldly, and in bad\r\ntaste.  At any other time I would have been not only glad, but proud, to\r\nreceive from a man like Mr. Greeley a letter of this kind, and would have\r\nstudied it earnestly and tried to improve myself all I could; but now,\r\nwith that poor boy in his far home languishing for relief, I had no heart\r\nfor learning.\r\n\r\n"Three days passed by, and I read the note again.  Again its tenor had\r\nchanged.  It now appeared to say:\r\n\r\n      "Potations do sometimes wake wines; turnips restrain passion; causes\r\n      necessary to state.  Infest the poor widow; her lord\'s effects will\r\n      be void.  But dirt, bathing, etc., etc., followed unfairly, will\r\n      worm him from his folly--so swear not.\r\n                                              Yrxwly, HEVACE EVEELOJ.\'\r\n\r\n"This was more like it.  But I was unable to proceed.  I was too much\r\nworn.  The word \'turnips\' brought temporary joy and encouragement, but my\r\nstrength was so much impaired, and the delay might be so perilous for the\r\nboy, that I relinquished the idea of pursuing the translation further,\r\nand resolved to do what I ought to have done at first.  I sat down and\r\nwrote Mr. Greeley as follows:\r\n\r\n      "DEAR SIR: I fear I do not entirely comprehend your kind note.  It\r\n      cannot be possible, Sir, that \'turnips restrain passion\'--at least\r\n      the study or contemplation of turnips cannot--for it is this very\r\n      employment that has scorched our poor friend\'s mind and sapped his\r\n      bodily strength.--But if they do restrain it, will you bear with us\r\n      a little further and explain how they should be prepared?  I observe\r\n      that you say \'causes necessary to state,\' but you have omitted to\r\n      state them.\r\n\r\n      "Under a misapprehension, you seem to attribute to me interested\r\n      motives in this matter--to call it by no harsher term.  But I assure\r\n      you, dear sir, that if I seem to be \'infesting the widow,\' it is all\r\n      seeming, and void of reality.  It is from no seeking of mine that I\r\n      am in this position.  She asked me, herself, to write you.  I never\r\n      have infested her--indeed I scarcely know her.  I do not infest\r\n      anybody.  I try to go along, in my humble way, doing as near right\r\n      as I can, never harming anybody, and never throwing out\r\n      insinuations.  As for \'her lord and his effects,\' they are of no\r\n      interest to me.  I trust I have effects enough of my own--shall\r\n      endeavor to get along with them, at any rate, and not go mousing\r\n      around to get hold of somebody\'s that are \'void.\'  But do you not\r\n      see?--this woman is a widow--she has no \'lord.\'  He is dead--or\r\n      pretended to be, when they buried him.  Therefore, no amount of\r\n      \'dirt, bathing,\' etc., etc., howsoever \'unfairly followed\' will be\r\n      likely to \'worm him from his folly\'--if being dead and a ghost is\r\n      \'folly.\'  Your closing remark is as unkind as it was uncalled for;\r\n      and if report says true you might have applied it to yourself, sir,\r\n      with more point and less impropriety.\r\n                               Very Truly Yours, SIMON ERICKSON.\r\n\r\n"In the course of a few days, Mr. Greely did what would have saved a\r\nworld of trouble, and much mental and bodily suffering and\r\nmisunderstanding, if he had done it sooner.  To wit, he sent an\r\nintelligible rescript or translation of his original note, made in a\r\nplain hand by his clerk.  Then the mystery cleared, and I saw that his\r\nheart had been right, all the time.  I will recite the note in its\r\nclarified form:\r\n\r\n      [Translation.]\r\n      \'Potatoes do sometimes make vines; turnips remain passive: cause\r\n      unnecessary to state.  Inform the poor widow her lad\'s efforts will\r\n      be vain.  But diet, bathing, etc.  etc., followed uniformly, will\r\n      wean him from his folly--so fear not.\r\n                                         Yours, HORACE GREELEY.\'\r\n\r\n"But alas, it was too late, gentlemen--too late.  The criminal delay had\r\ndone its work--young Beazely was no more.  His spirit had taken its\r\nflight to a land where all anxieties shall be charmed away, all desires\r\ngratified, all ambitions realized.  Poor lad, they laid him to his rest\r\nwith a turnip in each hand."\r\n\r\nSo ended Erickson, and lapsed again into nodding, mumbling, and\r\nabstraction.  The company broke up, and left him so....  But they did not\r\nsay what drove him crazy.  In the momentary confusion, I forgot to ask.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI.\r\n\r\nAt four o\'clock in the afternoon we were winding down a mountain of\r\ndreary and desolate lava to the sea, and closing our pleasant land\r\njourney.  This lava is the accumulation of ages; one torrent of fire\r\nafter another has rolled down here in old times, and built up the island\r\nstructure higher and higher.  Underneath, it is honey-combed with caves;\r\nit would be of no use to dig wells in such a place; they would not hold\r\nwater--you would not find any for them to hold, for that matter.\r\nConsequently, the planters depend upon cisterns.\r\n\r\nThe last lava flow occurred here so long ago that there are none now\r\nliving who witnessed it.  In one place it enclosed and burned down a\r\ngrove of cocoa-nut trees, and the holes in the lava where the trunks\r\nstood are still visible; their sides retain the impression of the bark;\r\nthe trees fell upon the burning river, and becoming partly submerged,\r\nleft in it the perfect counterpart of every knot and branch and leaf,\r\nand even nut, for curiosity seekers of a long distant day to gaze upon\r\nand wonder at.\r\n\r\nThere were doubtless plenty of Kanaka sentinels on guard hereabouts at\r\nthat time, but they did not leave casts of their figures in the lava as\r\nthe Roman sentinels at Herculaneum and Pompeii did.  It is a pity it is\r\nso, because such things are so interesting; but so it is.  They probably\r\nwent away.  They went away early, perhaps.  However, they had their\r\nmerits; the Romans exhibited the higher pluck, but the Kanakas showed the\r\nsounder judgment.\r\n\r\nShortly we came in sight of that spot whose history is so familiar to\r\nevery school-boy in the wide world--Kealakekua Bay--the place where\r\nCaptain Cook, the great circumnavigator, was killed by the natives,\r\nnearly a hundred years ago.  The setting sun was flaming upon it, a\r\nSummer shower was falling, and it was spanned by two magnificent\r\nrainbows.  Two men who were in advance of us rode through one of these\r\nand for a moment their garments shone with a more than regal splendor.\r\nWhy did not Captain Cook have taste enough to call his great discovery\r\nthe Rainbow Islands?  These charming spectacles are present to you at\r\nevery turn; they are common in all the islands; they are visible every\r\nday, and frequently at night also--not the silvery bow we see once in an\r\nage in the States, by moonlight, but barred with all bright and beautiful\r\ncolors, like the children of the sun and rain.  I saw one of them a few\r\nnights ago.  What the sailors call "raindogs"--little patches of rainbow\r\n--are often seen drifting about the heavens in these latitudes, like\r\nstained cathedral windows.\r\n\r\nKealakekua Bay is a little curve like the last kink of a snail-shell,\r\nwinding deep into the land, seemingly not more than a mile wide from\r\nshore to shore.  It is bounded on one side--where the murder was done--by\r\na little flat plain, on which stands a cocoanut grove and some ruined\r\nhouses; a steep wall of lava, a thousand feet high at the upper end and\r\nthree or four hundred at the lower, comes down from the mountain and\r\nbounds the inner extremity of it.  From this wall the place takes its\r\nname, Kealakekua, which in the native tongue signifies "The Pathway of\r\nthe Gods."  They say, (and still believe, in spite of their liberal\r\neducation in Christianity), that the great god Lono, who used to live\r\nupon the hillside, always traveled that causeway when urgent business\r\nconnected with heavenly affairs called him down to the seashore in a\r\nhurry.\r\n\r\nAs the red sun looked across the placid ocean through the tall, clean\r\nstems of the cocoanut trees, like a blooming whiskey bloat through the\r\nbars of a city prison, I went and stood in the edge of the water on the\r\nflat rock pressed by Captain Cook\'s feet when the blow was dealt which\r\ntook away his life, and tried to picture in my mind the doomed man\r\nstruggling in the midst of the multitude of exasperated savages--the men\r\nin the ship crowding to the vessel\'s side and gazing in anxious dismay\r\ntoward the shore--the--but I discovered that I could not do it.\r\n\r\nIt was growing dark, the rain began to fall, we could see that the\r\ndistant Boomerang was helplessly becalmed at sea, and so I adjourned to\r\nthe cheerless little box of a warehouse and sat down to smoke and think,\r\nand wish the ship would make the land--for we had not eaten much for ten\r\nhours and were viciously hungry.\r\n\r\nPlain unvarnished history takes the romance out of Captain Cook\'s\r\nassassination, and renders a deliberate verdict of justifiable homicide.\r\nWherever he went among the islands, he was cordially received and\r\nwelcomed by the inhabitants, and his ships lavishly supplied with all\r\nmanner of food.  He returned these kindnesses with insult and\r\nill-treatment.  Perceiving that the people took him for the long vanished\r\nand lamented god Lono, he encouraged them in the delusion for the sake of\r\nthe limitless power it gave him; but during the famous disturbance at\r\nthis spot, and while he and his comrades were surrounded by fifteen\r\nthousand maddened savages, he received a hurt and betrayed his earthly\r\norigin with a groan.  It was his death-warrant.  Instantly a shout went\r\nup: "He groans!--he is not a god!" So they closed in upon him and\r\ndispatched him.\r\n\r\nHis flesh was stripped from the bones and burned (except nine pounds of\r\nit which were sent on board the ships).  The heart was hung up in a\r\nnative hut, where it was found and eaten by three children, who mistook\r\nit for the heart of a dog.  One of these children grew to be a very old\r\nman, and died in Honolulu a few years ago.  Some of Cook\'s bones were\r\nrecovered and consigned to the deep by the officers of the ships.\r\n\r\nSmall blame should attach to the natives for the killing of Cook.\r\nThey treated him well.  In return, he abused them.  He and his men\r\ninflicted bodily injury upon many of them at different times, and killed\r\nat least three of them before they offered any proportionate retaliation.\r\n\r\nNear the shore we found "Cook\'s Monument"--only a cocoanut stump, four\r\nfeet high and about a foot in diameter at the butt.  It had lava boulders\r\npiled around its base to hold it up and keep it in its place, and it was\r\nentirely sheathed over, from top to bottom, with rough, discolored sheets\r\nof copper, such as ships\' bottoms are coppered with.  Each sheet had a\r\nrude inscription scratched upon it--with a nail, apparently--and in every\r\ncase the execution was wretched.  Most of these merely recorded the\r\nvisits of British naval commanders to the spot, but one of them bore this\r\nlegend:\r\n\r\n     "Near this spot fell\r\n      CAPTAIN JAMES COOK,\r\n      The Distinguished Circumnavigator,\r\n      Who Discovered these Islands\r\n      A. D.  1778."\r\n\r\nAfter Cook\'s murder, his second in command, on board the ship, opened\r\nfire upon the swarms of natives on the beach, and one of his cannon balls\r\ncut this cocoanut tree short off and left this monumental stump standing.\r\nIt looked sad and lonely enough to us, out there in the rainy twilight.\r\nBut there is no other monument to Captain Cook.  True, up on the mountain\r\nside we had passed by a large inclosure like an ample hog-pen, built of\r\nlava blocks, which marks the spot where Cook\'s flesh was stripped from\r\nhis bones and burned; but this is not properly a monument since it was\r\nerected by the natives themselves, and less to do honor to the\r\ncircumnavigator than for the sake of convenience in roasting him.\r\nA thing like a guide-board was elevated above this pen on a tall pole,\r\nand formerly there was an inscription upon it describing the memorable\r\noccurrence that had there taken place; but the sun and the wind have long\r\nago so defaced it as to render it illegible.\r\n\r\nToward midnight a fine breeze sprang up and the schooner soon worked\r\nherself into the bay and cast anchor.  The boat came ashore for us, and\r\nin a little while the clouds and the rain were all gone.  The moon was\r\nbeaming tranquilly down on land and sea, and we two were stretched upon\r\nthe deck sleeping the refreshing sleep and dreaming the happy dreams that\r\nare only vouchsafed to the weary and the innocent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII.\r\n\r\nIn the breezy morning we went ashore and visited the ruined temple of the\r\nlast god Lono.  The high chief cook of this temple--the priest who\r\npresided over it and roasted the human sacrifices--was uncle to Obookia,\r\nand at one time that youth was an apprentice-priest under him.  Obookia\r\nwas a young native of fine mind, who, together with three other native\r\nboys, was taken to New England by the captain of a whaleship during the\r\nreign of Kamehameha I, and they were the means of attracting the\r\nattention of the religious world to their country.  This resulted in the\r\nsending of missionaries there.  And this Obookia was the very same\r\nsensitive savage who sat down on the church steps and wept because his\r\npeople did not have the Bible.  That incident has been very elaborately\r\npainted in many a charming Sunday School book--aye, and told so\r\nplaintively and so tenderly that I have cried over it in Sunday School\r\nmyself, on general principles, although at a time when I did not know\r\nmuch and could not understand why the people of the Sandwich Islands\r\nneeded to worry so much about it as long as they did not know there was a\r\nBible at all.\r\n\r\nObookia was converted and educated, and was to have returned to his\r\nnative land with the first missionaries, had he lived.  The other native\r\nyouths made the voyage, and two of them did good service, but the third,\r\nWilliam Kanui, fell from grace afterward, for a time, and when the gold\r\nexcitement broke out in California he journeyed thither and went to\r\nmining, although he was fifty years old.  He succeeded pretty well, but\r\nthe failure of Page, Bacon & Co. relieved him of six thousand dollars,\r\nand then, to all intents and purposes, he was a bankrupt in his old age\r\nand he resumed service in the pulpit again.  He died in Honolulu in 1864.\r\n\r\nQuite a broad tract of land near the temple, extending from the sea to\r\nthe mountain top, was sacred to the god Lono in olden times--so sacred\r\nthat if a common native set his sacrilegious foot upon it it was\r\njudicious for him to make his will, because his time had come.  He might\r\ngo around it by water, but he could not cross it.  It was well sprinkled\r\nwith pagan temples and stocked with awkward, homely idols carved out of\r\nlogs of wood.  There was a temple devoted to prayers for rain--and with\r\nfine sagacity it was placed at a point so well up on the mountain side\r\nthat if you prayed there twenty-four times a day for rain you would be\r\nlikely to get it every time.  You would seldom get to your Amen before\r\nyou would have to hoist your umbrella.\r\n\r\nAnd there was a large temple near at hand which was built in a single\r\nnight, in the midst of storm and thunder and rain, by the ghastly hands\r\nof dead men!  Tradition says that by the weird glare of the lightning a\r\nnoiseless multitude of phantoms were seen at their strange labor far up\r\nthe mountain side at dead of night--flitting hither and thither and\r\nbearing great lava-blocks clasped in their nerveless fingers--appearing\r\nand disappearing as the pallid lustre fell upon their forms and faded\r\naway again.  Even to this day, it is said, the natives hold this dread\r\nstructure in awe and reverence, and will not pass by it in the night.\r\n\r\nAt noon I observed a bevy of nude native young ladies bathing in the sea,\r\nand went and sat down on their clothes to keep them from being stolen.\r\nI begged them to come out, for the sea was rising and I was satisfied\r\nthat they were running some risk.  But they were not afraid, and\r\npresently went on with their sport.  They were finished swimmers and\r\ndivers, and enjoyed themselves to the last degree.\r\n\r\nThey swam races, splashed and ducked and tumbled each other about, and\r\nfilled the air with their laughter.  It is said that the first thing an\r\nIslander learns is how to swim; learning to walk being a matter of\r\nsmaller consequence, comes afterward.  One hears tales of native men and\r\nwomen swimming ashore from vessels many miles at sea--more miles, indeed,\r\nthan I dare vouch for or even mention.  And they tell of a native diver\r\nwho went down in thirty or forty-foot waters and brought up an anvil!\r\nI think he swallowed the anvil afterward, if my memory serves me.\r\nHowever I will not urge this point.\r\n\r\nI have spoken, several times, of the god Lono--I may as well furnish two\r\nor three sentences concerning him.\r\n\r\nThe idol the natives worshipped for him was a slender, unornamented staff\r\ntwelve feet long.  Tradition says he was a favorite god on the Island of\r\nHawaii--a great king who had been deified for meritorious services--just\r\nour own fashion of rewarding heroes, with the difference that we would\r\nhave made him a Postmaster instead of a god, no doubt.  In an angry\r\nmoment he slew his wife, a goddess named Kaikilani Aiii.  Remorse of\r\nconscience drove him mad, and tradition presents us the singular\r\nspectacle of a god traveling "on the shoulder;" for in his gnawing grief\r\nhe wandered about from place to place boxing and wrestling with all whom\r\nhe met.  Of course this pastime soon lost its novelty, inasmuch as it\r\nmust necessarily have been the case that when so powerful a deity sent a\r\nfrail human opponent "to grass" he never came back any more.  Therefore,\r\nhe instituted games called makahiki, and ordered that they should be held\r\nin his honor, and then sailed for foreign lands on a three-cornered raft,\r\nstating that he would return some day--and that was the last of Lono.\r\nHe was never seen any more; his raft got swamped, perhaps.  But the\r\npeople always expected his return, and thus they were easily led to\r\naccept Captain Cook as the restored god.\r\n\r\nSome of the old natives believed Cook was Lono to the day of their death;\r\nbut many did not, for they could not understand how he could die if he\r\nwas a god.\r\n\r\nOnly a mile or so from Kealakekua Bay is a spot of historic interest--the\r\nplace where the last battle was fought for idolatry.  Of course we\r\nvisited it, and came away as wise as most people do who go and gaze upon\r\nsuch mementoes of the past when in an unreflective mood.\r\n\r\nWhile the first missionaries were on their way around the Horn, the\r\nidolatrous customs which had obtained in the island, as far back as\r\ntradition reached were suddenly broken up.  Old Kamehameha I., was dead,\r\nand his son, Liholiho, the new King was a free liver, a roystering,\r\ndissolute fellow, and hated the restraints of the ancient tabu.  His\r\nassistant in the Government, Kaahumanu, the Queen dowager, was proud and\r\nhigh-spirited, and hated the tabu because it restricted the privileges of\r\nher sex and degraded all women very nearly to the level of brutes.\r\nSo the case stood.  Liholiho had half a mind to put his foot down,\r\nKaahumahu had a whole mind to badger him into doing it, and whiskey did\r\nthe rest.  It was probably the rest.  It was probably the first time\r\nwhiskey ever prominently figured as an aid to civilization.  Liholiho\r\ncame up to Kailua as drunk as a piper, and attended a great feast; the\r\ndetermined Queen spurred his drunken courage up to a reckless pitch, and\r\nthen, while all the multitude stared in blank dismay, he moved\r\ndeliberately forward and sat down with the women!\r\n\r\nThey saw him eat from the same vessel with them, and were appalled!\r\nTerrible moments drifted slowly by, and still the King ate, still he\r\nlived, still the lightnings of the insulted gods were withheld!\r\nThen conviction came like a revelation--the superstitions of a hundred\r\ngenerations passed from before the people like a cloud, and a shout went\r\nup, "the tabu is broken!  the tabu is broken!"\r\n\r\nThus did King Liholiho and his dreadful whiskey preach the first sermon\r\nand prepare the way for the new gospel that was speeding southward over\r\nthe waves of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe tabu broken and destruction failing to follow the awful sacrilege,\r\nthe people, with that childlike precipitancy which has always\r\ncharacterized them, jumped to the conclusion that their gods were a weak\r\nand wretched swindle, just as they formerly jumped to the conclusion that\r\nCaptain Cook was no god, merely because he groaned, and promptly killed\r\nhim without stopping to inquire whether a god might not groan as well as\r\na man if it suited his convenience to do it; and satisfied that the idols\r\nwere powerless to protect themselves they went to work at once and pulled\r\nthem down--hacked them to pieces--applied the torch--annihilated them!\r\n\r\nThe pagan priests were furious.  And well they might be; they had held\r\nthe fattest offices in the land, and now they were beggared; they had\r\nbeen great--they had stood above the chiefs--and now they were vagabonds.\r\nThey raised a revolt; they scared a number of people into joining their\r\nstandard, and Bekuokalani, an ambitious offshoot of royalty, was easily\r\npersuaded to become their leader.\r\n\r\nIn the first skirmish the idolaters triumphed over the royal army sent\r\nagainst them, and full of confidence they resolved to march upon Kailua.\r\nThe King sent an envoy to try and conciliate them, and came very near\r\nbeing an envoy short by the operation; the savages not only refused to\r\nlisten to him, but wanted to kill him.  So the King sent his men forth\r\nunder Major General Kalaimoku and the two host met a Kuamoo.  The battle\r\nwas long and fierce--men and women fighting side by side, as was the\r\ncustom--and when the day was done the rebels were flying in every\r\ndirection in hopeless panic, and idolatry and the tabu were dead in the\r\nland!\r\n\r\nThe royalists marched gayly home to Kailua glorifying the new\r\ndispensation.  "There is no power in the gods," said they; "they are a\r\nvanity and a lie.  The army with idols was weak; the army without idols\r\nwas strong and victorious!"\r\n\r\nThe nation was without a religion.\r\n\r\nThe missionary ship arrived in safety shortly afterward, timed by\r\nprovidential exactness to meet the emergency, and the Gospel was planted\r\nas in a virgin soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIII.\r\n\r\nAt noon, we hired a Kanaka to take us down to the ancient ruins at\r\nHonaunan in his canoe--price two dollars--reasonable enough, for a sea\r\nvoyage of eight miles, counting both ways.\r\n\r\nThe native canoe is an irresponsible looking contrivance.  I cannot think\r\nof anything to liken it to but a boy\'s sled runner hollowed out, and that\r\ndoes not quite convey the correct idea.  It is about fifteen feet long,\r\nhigh and pointed at both ends, is a foot and a half or two feet deep, and\r\nso narrow that if you wedged a fat man into it you might not get him out\r\nagain.  It sits on top of the water like a duck, but it has an outrigger\r\nand does not upset easily, if you keep still.  This outrigger is formed\r\nof two long bent sticks like plow handles, which project from one side,\r\nand to their outer ends is bound a curved beam composed of an extremely\r\nlight wood, which skims along the surface of the water and thus saves you\r\nfrom an upset on that side, while the outrigger\'s weight is not so easily\r\nlifted as to make an upset on the other side a thing to be greatly\r\nfeared.  Still, until one gets used to sitting perched upon this\r\nknifeblade, he is apt to reason within himself that it would be more\r\ncomfortable if there were just an outrigger or so on the other side also.\r\nI had the bow seat, and Billings sat amidships and faced the Kanaka, who\r\noccupied the stern of the craft and did the paddling.  With the first\r\nstroke the trim shell of a thing shot out from the shore like an arrow.\r\nThere was not much to see.  While we were on the shallow water of the\r\nreef, it was pastime to look down into the limpid depths at the large\r\nbunches of branching coral--the unique shrubbery of the sea.  We lost\r\nthat, though, when we got out into the dead blue water of the deep.\r\nBut we had the picture of the surf, then, dashing angrily against the\r\ncrag-bound shore and sending a foaming spray high into the air.\r\n\r\nThere was interest in this beetling border, too, for it was honey-combed\r\nwith quaint caves and arches and tunnels, and had a rude semblance of the\r\ndilapidated architecture of ruined keeps and castles rising out of the\r\nrestless sea.  When this novelty ceased to be a novelty, we turned our\r\neyes shoreward and gazed at the long mountain with its rich green forests\r\nstretching up into the curtaining clouds, and at the specks of houses in\r\nthe rearward distance and the diminished schooner riding sleepily at\r\nanchor.  And when these grew tiresome we dashed boldly into the midst of\r\na school of huge, beastly porpoises engaged at their eternal game of\r\narching over a wave and disappearing, and then doing it over again and\r\nkeeping it up--always circling over, in that way, like so many\r\nwell-submerged wheels.  But the porpoises wheeled themselves away, and\r\nthen we were thrown upon our own resources.  It did not take many minutes\r\nto discover that the sun was blazing like a bonfire, and that the weather\r\nwas of a melting temperature.  It had a drowsing effect, too. In one\r\nplace we came upon a large company of naked natives, of both sexes and\r\nall ages, amusing themselves with the national pastime of surf-bathing.\r\nEach heathen would paddle three or four hundred yards out to sea, (taking\r\na short board with him), then face the shore and wait for a particularly\r\nprodigious billow to come along; at the right moment he would fling his\r\nboard upon its foamy crest and himself upon the board, and here he would\r\ncome whizzing by like a bombshell!  It did not seem that a lightning\r\nexpress train could shoot along at a more hair-lifting speed.  I tried\r\nsurf-bathing once, subsequently, but made a failure of it.  I got the\r\nboard placed right, and at the right moment, too; but missed the\r\nconnection myself.--The board struck the shore in three quarters of a\r\nsecond, without any cargo, and I struck the bottom about the same time,\r\nwith a couple of barrels of water in me.  None but natives ever master\r\nthe art of surf-bathing thoroughly.\r\n\r\nAt the end of an hour, we had made the four miles, and landed on a level\r\npoint of land, upon which was a wide extent of old ruins, with many a\r\ntall cocoanut tree growing among them.  Here was the ancient City of\r\nRefuge--a vast inclosure, whose stone walls were twenty feet thick at the\r\nbase, and fifteen feet high; an oblong square, a thousand and forty feet\r\none way and a fraction under seven hundred the other.  Within this\r\ninclosure, in early times, has been three rude temples; each two hundred\r\nand ten feet long by one hundred wide, and thirteen high.\r\n\r\nIn those days, if a man killed another anywhere on the island the\r\nrelatives were privileged to take the murderer\'s life; and then a chase\r\nfor life and liberty began--the outlawed criminal flying through pathless\r\nforests and over mountain and plain, with his hopes fixed upon the\r\nprotecting walls of the City of Refuge, and the avenger of blood\r\nfollowing hotly after him!\r\n\r\nSometimes the race was kept up to the very gates of the temple, and the\r\npanting pair sped through long files of excited natives, who watched the\r\ncontest with flashing eye and dilated nostril, encouraging the hunted\r\nrefugee with sharp, inspiriting ejaculations, and sending up a ringing\r\nshout of exultation when the saving gates closed upon him and the cheated\r\npursuer sank exhausted at the threshold.  But sometimes the flying\r\ncriminal fell under the hand of the avenger at the very door, when one\r\nmore brave stride, one more brief second of time would have brought his\r\nfeet upon the sacred ground and barred him against all harm.  Where did\r\nthese isolated pagans get this idea of a City of Refuge--this ancient\r\nOriental custom?\r\n\r\nThis old sanctuary was sacred to all--even to rebels in arms and invading\r\narmies.  Once within its walls, and confession made to the priest and\r\nabsolution obtained, the wretch with a price upon his head could go forth\r\nwithout fear and without danger--he was tabu, and to harm him was death.\r\nThe routed rebels in the lost battle for idolatry fled to this place to\r\nclaim sanctuary, and many were thus saved.\r\n\r\nClose to the corner of the great inclosure is a round structure of stone,\r\nsome six or eight feet high, with a level top about ten or twelve in\r\ndiameter.  This was the place of execution.  A high palisade of cocoanut\r\npiles shut out the cruel scenes from the vulgar multitude.  Here\r\ncriminals were killed, the flesh stripped from the bones and burned, and\r\nthe bones secreted in holes in the body of the structure.  If the man had\r\nbeen guilty of a high crime, the entire corpse was burned.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the temple are a study.  The same food for speculation that\r\nis offered the visitor to the Pyramids of Egypt he will find here--the\r\nmystery of how they were constructed by a people unacquainted with\r\nscience and mechanics.  The natives have no invention of their own for\r\nhoisting heavy weights, they had no beasts of burden, and they have never\r\neven shown any knowledge of the properties of the lever.  Yet some of the\r\nlava blocks quarried out, brought over rough, broken ground, and built\r\ninto this wall, six or seven feet from the ground, are of prodigious size\r\nand would weigh tons.  How did they transport and how raise them?\r\n\r\nBoth the inner and outer surfaces of the walls present a smooth front and\r\nare very creditable specimens of masonry.  The blocks are of all manner\r\nof shapes and sizes, but yet are fitted together with the neatest\r\nexactness.  The gradual narrowing of the wall from the base upward is\r\naccurately preserved.\r\n\r\nNo cement was used, but the edifice is firm and compact and is capable of\r\nresisting storm and decay for centuries.  Who built this temple, and how\r\nwas it built, and when, are mysteries that may never be unraveled.\r\nOutside of these ancient walls lies a sort of coffin-shaped stone eleven\r\nfeet four inches long and three feet square at the small end (it would\r\nweigh a few thousand pounds), which the high chief who held sway over\r\nthis district many centuries ago brought thither on his shoulder one day\r\nto use as a lounge!  This circumstance is established by the most\r\nreliable traditions.  He used to lie down on it, in his indolent way, and\r\nkeep an eye on his subjects at work for him and see that there was no\r\n"soldiering" done.  And no doubt there was not any done to speak of,\r\nbecause he was a man of that sort of build that incites to attention to\r\nbusiness on the part of an employee.\r\n\r\nHe was fourteen or fifteen feet high.  When he stretched himself at full\r\nlength on his lounge, his legs hung down over the end, and when he snored\r\nhe woke the dead.  These facts are all attested by irrefragable\r\ntradition.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the temple is a monstrous seven-ton rock, eleven\r\nfeet long, seven feet wide and three feet thick.  It is raised a foot or\r\na foot and a half above the ground, and rests upon half a dozen little\r\nstony pedestals.  The same old fourteen-footer brought it down from the\r\nmountain, merely for fun (he had his own notions about fun), and propped\r\nit up as we find it now and as others may find it a century hence, for it\r\nwould take a score of horses to budge it from its position.  They say\r\nthat fifty or sixty years ago the proud Queen Kaahumanu used to fly to\r\nthis rock for safety, whenever she had been making trouble with her\r\nfierce husband, and hide under it until his wrath was appeased.  But\r\nthese Kanakas will lie, and this statement is one of their ablest\r\nefforts--for Kaahumanu was six feet high--she was bulky--she was built\r\nlike an ox--and she could no more have squeezed herself under that rock\r\nthan she could have passed between the cylinders of a sugar mill.  What\r\ncould she gain by it, even if she succeeded?  To be chased and abused by\r\na savage husband could not be otherwise than humiliating to her high\r\nspirit, yet it could never make her feel so flat as an hour\'s repose\r\nunder that rock would.\r\n\r\nWe walked a mile over a raised macadamized road of uniform width; a road\r\npaved with flat stones and exhibiting in its every detail a considerable\r\ndegree of engineering skill.  Some say that that wise old pagan,\r\nKamehameha I planned and built it, but others say it was built so long\r\nbefore his time that the knowledge of who constructed it has passed out\r\nof the traditions.  In either case, however, as the handiwork of an\r\nuntaught and degraded race it is a thing of pleasing interest.  The\r\nstones are worn and smooth, and pushed apart in places, so that the road\r\nhas the exact appearance of those ancient paved highways leading out of\r\nRome which one sees in pictures.\r\n\r\nThe object of our tramp was to visit a great natural curiosity at the\r\nbase of the foothills--a congealed cascade of lava.  Some old forgotten\r\nvolcanic eruption sent its broad river of fire down the mountain side\r\nhere, and it poured down in a great torrent from an overhanging bluff\r\nsome fifty feet high to the ground below.  The flaming torrent cooled in\r\nthe winds from the sea, and remains there to-day, all seamed, and frothed\r\nand rippled a petrified Niagara.  It is very picturesque, and withal so\r\nnatural that one might almost imagine it still flowed.  A smaller stream\r\ntrickled over the cliff and built up an isolated pyramid about thirty\r\nfeet high, which has the semblance of a mass of large gnarled and knotted\r\nvines and roots and stems intricately twisted and woven together.\r\n\r\nWe passed in behind the cascade and the pyramid, and found the bluff\r\npierced by several cavernous tunnels, whose crooked courses we followed a\r\nlong distance.\r\n\r\nTwo of these winding tunnels stand as proof of Nature\'s mining abilities.\r\nTheir floors are level, they are seven feet wide, and their roofs are\r\ngently arched.  Their height is not uniform, however.  We passed through\r\none a hundred feet long, which leads through a spur of the hill and opens\r\nout well up in the sheer wall of a precipice whose foot rests in the\r\nwaves of the sea.  It is a commodious tunnel, except that there are\r\noccasional places in it where one must stoop to pass under.  The roof is\r\nlava, of course, and is thickly studded with little lava-pointed icicles\r\nan inch long, which hardened as they dripped.  They project as closely\r\ntogether as the iron teeth of a corn-sheller, and if one will stand up\r\nstraight and walk any distance there, he can get his hair combed free of\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIV.\r\n\r\nWe got back to the schooner in good time, and then sailed down to Kau,\r\nwhere we disembarked and took final leave of the vessel.  Next day we\r\nbought horses and bent our way over the summer-clad mountain-terraces,\r\ntoward the great volcano of Kilauea (Ke-low-way-ah).  We made nearly a\r\ntwo days\' journey of it, but that was on account of laziness.  Toward\r\nsunset on the second day, we reached an elevation of some four thousand\r\nfeet above sea level, and as we picked our careful way through billowy\r\nwastes of lava long generations ago stricken dead and cold in the climax\r\nof its tossing fury, we began to come upon signs of the near presence of\r\nthe volcano--signs in the nature of ragged fissures that discharged jets\r\nof sulphurous vapor into the air, hot from the molten ocean down in the\r\nbowels of the mountain.\r\n\r\nShortly the crater came into view.  I have seen Vesuvius since, but it\r\nwas a mere toy, a child\'s volcano, a soup-kettle, compared to this.\r\nMount Vesuvius is a shapely cone thirty-six hundred feet high; its crater\r\nan inverted cone only three hundred feet deep, and not more than a\r\nthousand feet in diameter, if as much as that; its fires meagre, modest,\r\nand docile.--But here was a vast, perpendicular, walled cellar, nine\r\nhundred feet deep in some places, thirteen hundred in others,\r\nlevel-floored, and ten miles in circumference!  Here was a yawning pit\r\nupon whose floor the armies of Russia could camp, and have room to spare.\r\n\r\nPerched upon the edge of the crater, at the opposite end from where we\r\nstood, was a small look-out house--say three miles away.  It assisted us,\r\nby comparison, to comprehend and appreciate the great depth of the basin\r\n--it looked like a tiny martin-box clinging at the eaves of a cathedral.\r\nAfter some little time spent in resting and looking and ciphering, we\r\nhurried on to the hotel.\r\n\r\nBy the path it is half a mile from the Volcano House to the\r\nlookout-house.  After a hearty supper we waited until it was thoroughly\r\ndark and then started to the crater.  The first glance in that direction\r\nrevealed a scene of wild beauty.  There was a heavy fog over the crater\r\nand it was splendidly illuminated by the glare from the fires below.  The\r\nillumination was two miles wide and a mile high, perhaps; and if you\r\never, on a dark night and at a distance beheld the light from thirty or\r\nforty blocks of distant buildings all on fire at once, reflected strongly\r\nagainst over-hanging clouds, you can form a fair idea of what this looked\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nA colossal column of cloud towered to a great height in the air\r\nimmediately above the crater, and the outer swell of every one of its\r\nvast folds was dyed with a rich crimson luster, which was subdued to a\r\npale rose tint in the depressions between.  It glowed like a muffled\r\ntorch and stretched upward to a dizzy height toward the zenith.  I\r\nthought it just possible that its like had not been seen since the\r\nchildren of Israel wandered on their long march through the desert so\r\nmany centuries ago over a path illuminated by the mysterious "pillar of\r\nfire."  And I was sure that I now had a vivid conception of what the\r\nmajestic "pillar of fire" was like, which almost amounted to a\r\nrevelation.\r\n\r\nArrived at the little thatched lookout house, we rested our elbows on the\r\nrailing in front and looked abroad over the wide crater and down over the\r\nsheer precipice at the seething fires beneath us.  The view was a\r\nstartling improvement on my daylight experience.  I turned to see the\r\neffect on the balance of the company and found the reddest-faced set of\r\nmen I almost ever saw.  In the strong light every countenance glowed like\r\nred-hot iron, every shoulder was suffused with crimson and shaded\r\nrearward into dingy, shapeless obscurity!  The place below looked like\r\nthe infernal regions and these men like half-cooled devils just come up\r\non a furlough.\r\n\r\nI turned my eyes upon the volcano again.  The "cellar" was tolerably well\r\nlighted up.  For a mile and a half in front of us and half a mile on\r\neither side, the floor of the abyss was magnificently illuminated; beyond\r\nthese limits the mists hung down their gauzy curtains and cast a\r\ndeceptive gloom over all that made the twinkling fires in the remote\r\ncorners of the crater seem countless leagues removed--made them seem like\r\nthe camp-fires of a great army far away.  Here was room for the\r\nimagination to work!  You could imagine those lights the width of a\r\ncontinent away--and that hidden under the intervening darkness were\r\nhills, and winding rivers, and weary wastes of plain and desert--and even\r\nthen the tremendous vista stretched on, and on, and on!--to the fires and\r\nfar beyond!  You could not compass it--it was the idea of eternity made\r\ntangible--and the longest end of it made visible to the naked eye!\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the vast floor of the desert under us was as black as\r\nink, and apparently smooth and level; but over a mile square of it was\r\nringed and streaked and striped with a thousand branching streams of\r\nliquid and gorgeously brilliant fire!  It looked like a colossal railroad\r\nmap of the State of Massachusetts done in chain lightning on a midnight\r\nsky.  Imagine it--imagine a coal-black sky shivered into a tangled\r\nnet-work of angry fire!\r\n\r\nHere and there were gleaming holes a hundred feet in diameter, broken in\r\nthe dark crust, and in them the melted lava--the color a dazzling white\r\njust tinged with yellow--was boiling and surging furiously; and from\r\nthese holes branched numberless bright torrents in many directions, like\r\nthe spokes of a wheel, and kept a tolerably straight course for a while\r\nand then swept round in huge rainbow curves, or made a long succession of\r\nsharp worm-fence angles, which looked precisely like the fiercest jagged\r\nlightning.  These streams met other streams, and they mingled with and\r\ncrossed and recrossed each other in every conceivable direction, like\r\nskate tracks on a popular skating ground.  Sometimes streams twenty or\r\nthirty feet wide flowed from the holes to some distance without dividing\r\n--and through the opera-glasses we could see that they ran down small,\r\nsteep hills and were genuine cataracts of fire, white at their source,\r\nbut soon cooling and turning to the richest red, grained with alternate\r\nlines of black and gold.  Every now and then masses of the dark crust\r\nbroke away and floated slowly down these streams like rafts down a river.\r\nOccasionally the molten lava flowing under the superincumbent crust broke\r\nthrough--split a dazzling streak, from five hundred to a thousand feet\r\nlong, like a sudden flash of lightning, and then acre after acre of the\r\ncold lava parted into fragments, turned up edgewise like cakes of ice\r\nwhen a great river breaks up, plunged downward and were swallowed in the\r\ncrimson cauldron.  Then the wide expanse of the "thaw" maintained a ruddy\r\nglow for a while, but shortly cooled and became black and level again.\r\nDuring a "thaw," every dismembered cake was marked by a glittering white\r\nborder which was superbly shaded inward by aurora borealis rays, which\r\nwere a flaming yellow where they joined the white border, and from thence\r\ntoward their points tapered into glowing crimson, then into a rich, pale\r\ncarmine, and finally into a faint blush that held its own a moment and\r\nthen dimmed and turned black.  Some of the streams preferred to mingle\r\ntogether in a tangle of fantastic circles, and then they looked something\r\nlike the confusion of ropes one sees on a ship\'s deck when she has just\r\ntaken in sail and dropped anchor--provided one can imagine those ropes on\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nThrough the glasses, the little fountains scattered about looked very\r\nbeautiful.  They boiled, and coughed, and spluttered, and discharged\r\nsprays of stringy red fire--of about the consistency of mush, for\r\ninstance--from ten to fifteen feet into the air, along with a shower of\r\nbrilliant white sparks--a quaint and unnatural mingling of gouts of blood\r\nand snow-flakes!\r\n\r\nWe had circles and serpents and streaks of lightning all twined and\r\nwreathed and tied together, without a break throughout an area more than\r\na mile square (that amount of ground was covered, though it was not\r\nstrictly "square"), and it was with a feeling of placid exultation that\r\nwe reflected that many years had elapsed since any visitor had seen such\r\na splendid display--since any visitor had seen anything more than the now\r\nsnubbed and insignificant "North" and "South" lakes in action.  We had\r\nbeen reading old files of Hawaiian newspapers and the "Record Book" at\r\nthe Volcano House, and were posted.\r\n\r\nI could see the North Lake lying out on the black floor away off in the\r\nouter edge of our panorama, and knitted to it by a web-work of lava\r\nstreams.  In its individual capacity it looked very little more\r\nrespectable than a schoolhouse on fire.  True, it was about nine hundred\r\nfeet long and two or three hundred wide, but then, under the present\r\ncircumstances, it necessarily appeared rather insignificant, and besides\r\nit was so distant from us.\r\n\r\nI forgot to say that the noise made by the bubbling lava is not great,\r\nheard as we heard it from our lofty perch.  It makes three distinct\r\nsounds--a rushing, a hissing, and a coughing or puffing sound; and if you\r\nstand on the brink and close your eyes it is no trick at all to imagine\r\nthat you are sweeping down a river on a large low-pressure steamer, and\r\nthat you hear the hissing of the steam about her boilers, the puffing\r\nfrom her escape-pipes and the churning rush of the water abaft her\r\nwheels.  The smell of sulphur is strong, but not unpleasant to a sinner.\r\n\r\nWe left the lookout house at ten o\'clock in a half cooked condition,\r\nbecause of the heat from Pele\'s furnaces, and wrapping up in blankets,\r\nfor the night was cold, we returned to our Hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXV.\r\n\r\nThe next night was appointed for a visit to the bottom of the crater, for\r\nwe desired to traverse its floor and see the "North Lake" (of fire) which\r\nlay two miles away, toward the further wall.  After dark half a dozen of\r\nus set out, with lanterns and native guides, and climbed down a crazy,\r\nthousand-foot pathway in a crevice fractured in the crater wall, and\r\nreached the bottom in safety.\r\n\r\nThe irruption of the previous evening had spent its force and the floor\r\nlooked black and cold; but when we ran out upon it we found it hot yet,\r\nto the feet, and it was likewise riven with crevices which revealed the\r\nunderlying fires gleaming vindictively.  A neighboring cauldron was\r\nthreatening to overflow, and this added to the dubiousness of the\r\nsituation.  So the native guides refused to continue the venture, and\r\nthen every body deserted except a stranger named Marlette.  He said he\r\nhad been in the crater a dozen times in daylight and believed he could\r\nfind his way through it at night.  He thought that a run of three hundred\r\nyards would carry us over the hottest part of the floor and leave us our\r\nshoe-soles.  His pluck gave me back-bone.  We took one lantern and\r\ninstructed the guides to hang the other to the roof of the look-out house\r\nto serve as a beacon for us in case we got lost, and then the party\r\nstarted back up the precipice and Marlette and I made our run.\r\nWe skipped over the hot floor and over the red crevices with brisk\r\ndispatch and reached the cold lava safe but with pretty warm feet.  Then\r\nwe took things leisurely and comfortably, jumping tolerably wide and\r\nprobably bottomless chasms, and threading our way through picturesque\r\nlava upheavals with considerable confidence.  When we got fairly away\r\nfrom the cauldrons of boiling fire, we seemed to be in a gloomy desert,\r\nand a suffocatingly dark one, surrounded by dim walls that seemed to\r\ntower to the sky.  The only cheerful objects were the glinting stars high\r\noverhead.\r\n\r\nBy and by Marlette shouted "Stop!" I never stopped quicker in my life.\r\nI asked what the matter was.  He said we were out of the path.  He said\r\nwe must not try to go on till we found it again, for we were surrounded\r\nwith beds of rotten lava through which we could easily break and plunge\r\ndown a thousand feet.  I thought eight hundred would answer for me, and\r\nwas about to say so when Marlette partly proved his statement by\r\naccidentally crushing through and disappearing to his arm-pits.\r\n\r\nHe got out and we hunted for the path with the lantern.  He said there\r\nwas only one path and that it was but vaguely defined.  We could not find\r\nit.  The lava surface was all alike in the lantern light.  But he was an\r\ningenious man.  He said it was not the lantern that had informed him that\r\nwe were out of the path, but his feet.  He had noticed a crisp grinding\r\nof fine lava-needles under his feet, and some instinct reminded him that\r\nin the path these were all worn away.  So he put the lantern behind him,\r\nand began to search with his boots instead of his eyes.  It was good\r\nsagacity.  The first time his foot touched a surface that did not grind\r\nunder it he announced that the trail was found again; and after that we\r\nkept up a sharp listening for the rasping sound and it always warned us\r\nin time.\r\n\r\nIt was a long tramp, but an exciting one.  We reached the North Lake\r\nbetween ten and eleven o\'clock, and sat down on a huge overhanging\r\nlava-shelf, tired but satisfied.  The spectacle presented was worth\r\ncoming double the distance to see.  Under us, and stretching away before\r\nus, was a heaving sea of molten fire of seemingly limitless extent.  The\r\nglare from it was so blinding that it was some time before we could bear\r\nto look upon it steadily.\r\n\r\nIt was like gazing at the sun at noon-day, except that the glare was not\r\nquite so white.  At unequal distances all around the shores of the lake\r\nwere nearly white-hot chimneys or hollow drums of lava, four or five feet\r\nhigh, and up through them were bursting gorgeous sprays of lava-gouts and\r\ngem spangles, some white, some red and some golden--a ceaseless\r\nbombardment, and one that fascinated the eye with its unapproachable\r\nsplendor.  The mere distant jets, sparkling up through an intervening\r\ngossamer veil of vapor, seemed miles away; and the further the curving\r\nranks of fiery fountains receded, the more fairy-like and beautiful they\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nNow and then the surging bosom of the lake under our noses would calm\r\ndown ominously and seem to be gathering strength for an enterprise; and\r\nthen all of a sudden a red dome of lava of the bulk of an ordinary\r\ndwelling would heave itself aloft like an escaping balloon, then burst\r\nasunder, and out of its heart would flit a pale-green film of vapor, and\r\nfloat upward and vanish in the darkness--a released soul soaring homeward\r\nfrom captivity with the damned, no doubt.  The crashing plunge of the\r\nruined dome into the lake again would send a world of seething billows\r\nlashing against the shores and shaking the foundations of our perch.  By\r\nand by, a loosened mass of the hanging shelf we sat on tumbled into the\r\nlake, jarring the surroundings like an earthquake and delivering a\r\nsuggestion that may have been intended for a hint, and may not.  We did\r\nnot wait to see.\r\n\r\nWe got lost again on our way back, and were more than an hour hunting for\r\nthe path.  We were where we could see the beacon lantern at the look-out\r\nhouse at the time, but thought it was a star and paid no attention to it.\r\nWe reached the hotel at two o\'clock in the morning pretty well fagged\r\nout.\r\n\r\nKilauea never overflows its vast crater, but bursts a passage for its\r\nlava through the mountain side when relief is necessary, and then the\r\ndestruction is fearful.  About 1840 it rent its overburdened stomach and\r\nsent a broad river of fire careering down to the sea, which swept away\r\nforests, huts, plantations and every thing else that lay in its path.\r\nThe stream was five miles broad, in places, and two hundred feet deep,\r\nand the distance it traveled was forty miles.  It tore up and bore away\r\nacre-patches of land on its bosom like rafts--rocks, trees and all\r\nintact.  At night the red glare was visible a hundred miles at sea; and\r\nat a distance of forty miles fine print could be read at midnight.  The\r\natmosphere was poisoned with sulphurous vapors and choked with falling\r\nashes, pumice stones and cinders; countless columns of smoke rose up and\r\nblended together in a tumbled canopy that hid the heavens and glowed with\r\na ruddy flush reflected from the fires below; here and there jets of lava\r\nsprung hundreds of feet into the air and burst into rocket-sprays that\r\nreturned to earth in a crimson rain; and all the while the laboring\r\nmountain shook with Nature\'s great palsy and voiced its distress in\r\nmoanings and the muffled booming of subterranean thunders.\r\n\r\nFishes were killed for twenty miles along the shore, where the lava\r\nentered the sea.  The earthquakes caused some loss of human life, and a\r\nprodigious tidal wave swept inland, carrying every thing before it and\r\ndrowning a number of natives.  The devastation consummated along the\r\nroute traversed by the river of lava was complete and incalculable.  Only\r\na Pompeii and a Herculaneum were needed at the foot of Kilauea to make\r\nthe story of the irruption immortal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVI.\r\n\r\nWe rode horseback all around the island of Hawaii (the crooked road\r\nmaking the distance two hundred miles), and enjoyed the journey very\r\nmuch.  We were more than a week making the trip, because our Kanaka\r\nhorses would not go by a house or a hut without stopping--whip and spur\r\ncould not alter their minds about it, and so we finally found that it\r\neconomized time to let them have their way.  Upon inquiry the mystery was\r\nexplained: the natives are such thorough-going gossips that they never\r\npass a house without stopping to swap news, and consequently their horses\r\nlearn to regard that sort of thing as an essential part of the whole duty\r\nof man, and his salvation not to be compassed without it.  However, at a\r\nformer crisis of my life I had once taken an aristocratic young lady out\r\ndriving, behind a horse that had just retired from a long and honorable\r\ncareer as the moving impulse of a milk wagon, and so this present\r\nexperience awoke a reminiscent sadness in me in place of the exasperation\r\nmore natural to the occasion.  I remembered how helpless I was that day,\r\nand how humiliated; how ashamed I was of having intimated to the girl\r\nthat I had always owned the horse and was accustomed to grandeur; how\r\nhard I tried to appear easy, and even vivacious, under suffering that was\r\nconsuming my vitals; how placidly and maliciously the girl smiled, and\r\nkept on smiling, while my hot blushes baked themselves into a permanent\r\nblood-pudding in my face; how the horse ambled from one side of the\r\nstreet to the other and waited complacently before every third house two\r\nminutes and a quarter while I belabored his back and reviled him in my\r\nheart; how I tried to keep him from turning corners and failed; how I\r\nmoved heaven and earth to get him out of town, and did not succeed; how\r\nhe traversed the entire settlement and delivered imaginary milk at a\r\nhundred and sixty-two different domiciles, and how he finally brought up\r\nat a dairy depot and refused to budge further, thus rounding and\r\ncompleting the revealment of what the plebeian service of his life had\r\nbeen; how, in eloquent silence, I walked the girl home, and how, when I\r\ntook leave of her, her parting remark scorched my soul and appeared to\r\nblister me all over: she said that my horse was a fine, capable animal,\r\nand I must have taken great comfort in him in my time--but that if I\r\nwould take along some milk-tickets next time, and appear to deliver them\r\nat the various halting places, it might expedite his movements a little.\r\nThere was a coolness between us after that.\r\n\r\nIn one place in the island of Hawaii, we saw a laced and ruffled cataract\r\nof limpid water leaping from a sheer precipice fifteen hundred feet high;\r\nbut that sort of scenery finds its stanchest ally in the arithmetic\r\nrather than in spectacular effect.  If one desires to be so stirred by a\r\npoem of Nature wrought in the happily commingled graces of picturesque\r\nrocks, glimpsed distances, foliage, color, shifting lights and shadows,\r\nand failing water, that the tears almost come into his eyes so potent is\r\nthe charm exerted, he need not go away from America to enjoy such an\r\nexperience.  The Rainbow Fall, in Watkins Glen (N.Y.), on the Erie\r\nrailway, is an example.  It would recede into pitiable insignificance if\r\nthe callous tourist drew on arithmetic on it; but left to compete for the\r\nhonors simply on scenic grace and beauty--the grand, the august and the\r\nsublime being barred the contest--it could challenge the old world and\r\nthe new to produce its peer.\r\n\r\nIn one locality, on our journey, we saw some horses that had been born\r\nand reared on top of the mountains, above the range of running water, and\r\nconsequently they had never drank that fluid in their lives, but had been\r\nalways accustomed to quenching their thirst by eating dew-laden or\r\nshower-wetted leaves.  And now it was destructively funny to see them\r\nsniff suspiciously at a pail of water, and then put in their noses and\r\ntry to take a bite out of the fluid, as if it were a solid.  Finding it\r\nliquid, they would snatch away their heads and fall to trembling,\r\nsnorting and showing other evidences of fright.  When they became\r\nconvinced at last that the water was friendly and harmless, they thrust\r\nin their noses up to their eyes, brought out a mouthful of water, and\r\nproceeded to chew it complacently.  We saw a man coax, kick and spur one\r\nof them five or ten minutes before he could make it cross a running\r\nstream.  It spread its nostrils, distended its eyes and trembled all\r\nover, just as horses customarily do in the presence of a serpent--and for\r\naught I know it thought the crawling stream was a serpent.\r\n\r\nIn due course of time our journey came to an end at Kawaehae (usually\r\npronounced To-a-hi--and before we find fault with this elaborate\r\northographical method of arriving at such an unostentatious result, let\r\nus lop off the ugh from our word "though").  I made this horseback trip\r\non a mule.  I paid ten dollars for him at Kau (Kah-oo), added four to get\r\nhim shod, rode him two hundred miles, and then sold him for fifteen\r\ndollars.  I mark the circumstance with a white stone (in the absence of\r\nchalk--for I never saw a white stone that a body could mark anything\r\nwith, though out of respect for the ancients I have tried it often\r\nenough); for up to that day and date it was the first strictly commercial\r\ntransaction I had ever entered into, and come out winner.  We returned to\r\nHonolulu, and from thence sailed to the island of Maui, and spent several\r\nweeks there very pleasantly.  I still remember, with a sense of indolent\r\nluxury, a picnicing excursion up a romantic gorge there, called the Iao\r\nValley.  The trail lay along the edge of a brawling stream in the bottom\r\nof the gorge--a shady route, for it was well roofed with the verdant\r\ndomes of forest trees.  Through openings in the foliage we glimpsed\r\npicturesque scenery that revealed ceaseless changes and new charms with\r\nevery step of our progress.  Perpendicular walls from one to three\r\nthousand feet high guarded the way, and were sumptuously plumed with\r\nvaried foliage, in places, and in places swathed in waving ferns.\r\nPassing shreds of cloud trailed their shadows across these shining\r\nfronts, mottling them with blots; billowy masses of white vapor hid the\r\nturreted summits, and far above the vapor swelled a background of\r\ngleaming green crags and cones that came and went, through the veiling\r\nmists, like islands drifting in a fog; sometimes the cloudy curtain\r\ndescended till half the canon wall was hidden, then shredded gradually\r\naway till only airy glimpses of the ferny front appeared through it--then\r\nswept aloft and left it glorified in the sun again.  Now and then, as our\r\nposition changed, rocky bastions swung out from the wall, a mimic ruin of\r\ncastellated ramparts and crumbling towers clothed with mosses and hung\r\nwith garlands of swaying vines, and as we moved on they swung back again\r\nand hid themselves once more in the foliage.  Presently a verdure-clad\r\nneedle of stone, a thousand feet high, stepped out from behind a corner,\r\nand mounted guard over the mysteries of the valley.  It seemed to me that\r\nif Captain Cook needed a monument, here was one ready made--therefore,\r\nwhy not put up his sign here, and sell out the venerable cocoanut stump?\r\n\r\nBut the chief pride of Maui is her dead volcano of Haleakala--which\r\nmeans, translated, "the house of the sun."  We climbed a thousand feet up\r\nthe side of this isolated colossus one afternoon; then camped, and next\r\nday climbed the remaining nine thousand feet, and anchored on the summit,\r\nwhere we built a fire and froze and roasted by turns, all night.  With\r\nthe first pallor of dawn we got up and saw things that were new to us.\r\nMounted on a commanding pinnacle, we watched Nature work her silent\r\nwonders.  The sea was spread abroad on every hand, its tumbled surface\r\nseeming only wrinkled and dimpled in the distance.  A broad valley below\r\nappeared like an ample checker-board, its velvety green sugar plantations\r\nalternating with dun squares of barrenness and groves of trees diminished\r\nto mossy tufts.  Beyond the valley were mountains picturesquely grouped\r\ntogether; but bear in mind, we fancied that we were looking up at these\r\nthings--not down.  We seemed to sit in the bottom of a symmetrical bowl\r\nten thousand feet deep, with the valley and the skirting sea lifted away\r\ninto the sky above us!  It was curious; and not only curious, but\r\naggravating; for it was having our trouble all for nothing, to climb ten\r\nthousand feet toward heaven and then have to look up at our scenery.\r\nHowever, we had to be content with it and make the best of it; for, all\r\nwe could do we could not coax our landscape down out of the clouds.\r\nFormerly, when I had read an article in which Poe treated of this\r\nsingular fraud perpetrated upon the eye by isolated great altitudes,\r\nI had looked upon the matter as an invention of his own fancy.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the outside view--but we had an inside one, too.  That\r\nwas the yawning dead crater, into which we now and then tumbled rocks,\r\nhalf as large as a barrel, from our perch, and saw them go careering down\r\nthe almost perpendicular sides, bounding three hundred feet at a jump;\r\nkicking up cast-clouds wherever they struck; diminishing to our view as\r\nthey sped farther into distance; growing invisible, finally, and only\r\nbetraying their course by faint little puffs of dust; and coming to a\r\nhalt at last in the bottom of the abyss, two thousand five hundred feet\r\ndown from where they started!  It was magnificent sport.  We wore\r\nourselves out at it.\r\n\r\nThe crater of Vesuvius, as I have before remarked, is a modest pit about\r\na thousand feet deep and three thousand in circumference; that of Kilauea\r\nis somewhat deeper, and ten miles in circumference.  But what are either\r\nof them compared to the vacant stomach of Haleakala?  I will not offer\r\nany figures of my own, but give official ones--those of Commander Wilkes,\r\nU.S.N., who surveyed it and testifies that it is twenty-seven miles in\r\ncircumference!  If it had a level bottom it would make a fine site for a\r\ncity like London.  It must have afforded a spectacle worth contemplating\r\nin the old days when its furnaces gave full rein to their anger.\r\n\r\nPresently vagrant white clouds came drifting along, high over the sea and\r\nthe valley; then they came in couples and groups; then in imposing\r\nsquadrons; gradually joining their forces, they banked themselves solidly\r\ntogether, a thousand feet under us, and totally shut out land and ocean\r\n--not a vestige of anything was left in view but just a little of the rim\r\nof the crater, circling away from the pinnacle whereon we sat (for a\r\nghostly procession of wanderers from the filmy hosts without had drifted\r\nthrough a chasm in the crater wall and filed round and round, and\r\ngathered and sunk and blended together till the abyss was stored to the\r\nbrim with a fleecy fog).  Thus banked, motion ceased, and silence\r\nreigned.  Clear to the horizon, league on league, the snowy floor\r\nstretched without a break--not level, but in rounded folds, with shallow\r\ncreases between, and with here and there stately piles of vapory\r\narchitecture lifting themselves aloft out of the common plain--some near\r\nat hand, some in the middle distances, and others relieving the monotony\r\nof the remote solitudes.  There was little conversation, for the\r\nimpressive scene overawed speech.  I felt like the Last Man, neglected of\r\nthe judgment, and left pinnacled in mid-heaven, a forgotten relic of a\r\nvanished world.\r\n\r\nWhile the hush yet brooded, the messengers of the coming resurrection\r\nappeared in the East.  A growing warmth suffused the horizon, and soon\r\nthe sun emerged and looked out over the cloud-waste, flinging bars of\r\nruddy light across it, staining its folds and billow-caps with blushes,\r\npurpling the shaded troughs between, and glorifying the massy\r\nvapor-palaces and cathedrals with a wasteful splendor of all blendings\r\nand combinations of rich coloring.\r\n\r\nIt was the sublimest spectacle I ever witnessed, and I think the memory\r\nof it will remain with me always.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVII.\r\n\r\nI stumbled upon one curious character in the Island of Mani.  He became a\r\nsore annoyance to me in the course of time.  My first glimpse of him was\r\nin a sort of public room in the town of Lahaina.  He occupied a chair at\r\nthe opposite side of the apartment, and sat eyeing our party with\r\ninterest for some minutes, and listening as critically to what we were\r\nsaying as if he fancied we were talking to him and expecting him to\r\nreply.  I thought it very sociable in a stranger.  Presently, in the\r\ncourse of conversation, I made a statement bearing upon the subject under\r\ndiscussion--and I made it with due modesty, for there was nothing\r\nextraordinary about it, and it was only put forth in illustration of a\r\npoint at issue.  I had barely finished when this person spoke out with\r\nrapid utterance and feverish anxiety:\r\n\r\n"Oh, that was certainly remarkable, after a fashion, but you ought to\r\nhave seen my chimney--you ought to have seen my chimney, sir!  Smoke!\r\nI wish I may hang if--Mr. Jones, you remember that chimney--you must\r\nremember that chimney!  No, no--I recollect, now, you warn\'t living on\r\nthis side of the island then.  But I am telling you nothing but the\r\ntruth, and I wish I may never draw another breath if that chimney didn\'t\r\nsmoke so that the smoke actually got caked in it and I had to dig it out\r\nwith a pickaxe!  You may smile, gentlemen, but the High Sheriff\'s got a\r\nhunk of it which I dug out before his eyes, and so it\'s perfectly easy\r\nfor you to go and examine for yourselves."\r\n\r\nThe interruption broke up the conversation, which had already begun to\r\nlag, and we presently hired some natives and an out-rigger canoe or two,\r\nand went out to overlook a grand surf-bathing contest.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks after this, while talking in a company, I looked up and\r\ndetected this same man boring through and through me with his intense\r\neye, and noted again his twitching muscles and his feverish anxiety to\r\nspeak.  The moment I paused, he said:\r\n\r\n"Beg your pardon, sir, beg your pardon, but it can only be considered\r\nremarkable when brought into strong outline by isolation.  Sir,\r\ncontrasted with a circumstance which occurred in my own experience, it\r\ninstantly becomes commonplace.  No, not that--for I will not speak so\r\ndiscourteously of any experience in the career of a stranger and a\r\ngentleman--but I am obliged to say that you could not, and you would not\r\never again refer to this tree as a large one, if you could behold, as I\r\nhave, the great Yakmatack tree, in the island of Ounaska, sea of\r\nKamtchatka--a tree, sir, not one inch less than four hundred and fifteen\r\nfeet in solid diameter!--and I wish I may die in a minute if it isn\'t so!\r\nOh, you needn\'t look so questioning, gentlemen; here\'s old Cap Saltmarsh\r\ncan say whether I know what I\'m talking about or not.  I showed him the\r\ntree."\r\n\r\nCaptain Saltmarsh--"Come, now, cat your anchor, lad--you\'re heaving too\r\ntaut.  You promised to show me that stunner, and I walked more than\r\neleven mile with you through the cussedest jungle I ever see, a hunting\r\nfor it; but the tree you showed me finally warn\'t as big around as a beer\r\ncask, and you know that your own self, Markiss."\r\n\r\n"Hear the man talk!  Of course the tree was reduced that way, but didn\'t\r\nI explain it?  Answer me, didn\'t I?  Didn\'t I say I wished you could have\r\nseen it when I first saw it?  When you got up on your ear and called me\r\nnames, and said I had brought you eleven miles to look at a sapling,\r\ndidn\'t I explain to you that all the whale-ships in the North Seas had\r\nbeen wooding off of it for more than twenty-seven years?  And did you\r\ns\'pose the tree could last for-ever, con-found it?  I don\'t see why you\r\nwant to keep back things that way, and try to injure a person that\'s\r\nnever done you any harm."\r\n\r\nSomehow this man\'s presence made me uncomfortable, and I was glad when a\r\nnative arrived at that moment to say that Muckawow, the most\r\ncompanionable and luxurious among the rude war-chiefs of the Islands,\r\ndesired us to come over and help him enjoy a missionary whom he had found\r\ntrespassing on his grounds.\r\n\r\nI think it was about ten days afterward that, as I finished a statement I\r\nwas making for the instruction of a group of friends and acquaintances,\r\nand which made no pretence of being extraordinary, a familiar voice\r\nchimed instantly in on the heels of my last word, and said:\r\n\r\n"But, my dear sir, there was nothing remarkable about that horse, or the\r\ncircumstance either--nothing in the world!  I mean no sort of offence\r\nwhen I say it, sir, but you really do not know anything whatever about\r\nspeed.  Bless your heart, if you could only have seen my mare Margaretta;\r\nthere was a beast!--there was lightning for you!  Trot!  Trot is no name\r\nfor it--she flew!  How she could whirl a buggy along!  I started her out\r\nonce, sir--Colonel Bilgewater, you recollect that animal perfectly well\r\n--I started her out about thirty or thirty-five yards ahead of the\r\nawfullest storm I ever saw in my life, and it chased us upwards of\r\neighteen miles!  It did, by the everlasting hills!  And I\'m telling you\r\nnothing but the unvarnished truth when I say that not one single drop of\r\nrain fell on me--not a single drop, sir!  And I swear to it!  But my dog\r\nwas a-swimming behind the wagon all the way!"\r\n\r\nFor a week or two I stayed mostly within doors, for I seemed to meet this\r\nperson everywhere, and he had become utterly hateful to me.  But one\r\nevening I dropped in on Captain Perkins and his friends, and we had a\r\nsociable time.  About ten o\'clock I chanced to be talking about a\r\nmerchant friend of mine, and without really intending it, the remark\r\nslipped out that he was a little mean and parsimonious about paying his\r\nworkmen.  Instantly, through the steam of a hot whiskey punch on the\r\nopposite side of the room, a remembered voice shot--and for a moment I\r\ntrembled on the imminent verge of profanity:\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear sir, really you expose yourself when you parade that as a\r\nsurprising circumstance.  Bless your heart and hide, you are ignorant of\r\nthe very A B C of meanness! ignorant as the unborn babe! ignorant as\r\nunborn twins!  You don\'t know anything about it!  It is pitiable to see\r\nyou, sir, a well-spoken and prepossessing stranger, making such an\r\nenormous pow-wow here about a subject concerning which your ignorance is\r\nperfectly humiliating!  Look me in the eye, if you please; look me in the\r\neye.  John James Godfrey was the son of poor but honest parents in the\r\nState of Mississippi--boyhood friend of mine--bosom comrade in later\r\nyears.  Heaven rest his noble spirit, he is gone from us now.  John James\r\nGodfrey was hired by the Hayblossom Mining Company in California to do\r\nsome blasting for them--the "Incorporated Company of Mean Men," the boys\r\nused to call it.\r\n\r\n"Well, one day he drilled a hole about four feet deep and put in an awful\r\nblast of powder, and was standing over it ramming it down with an iron\r\ncrowbar about nine foot long, when the cussed thing struck a spark and\r\nfired the powder, and scat! away John Godfrey whizzed like a skyrocket,\r\nhim and his crowbar!  Well, sir, he kept on going up in the air higher\r\nand higher, till he didn\'t look any bigger than a boy--and he kept going\r\non up higher and higher, till he didn\'t look any bigger than a doll--and\r\nhe kept on going up higher and higher, till he didn\'t look any bigger\r\nthan a little small bee--and then he went out of sight!  Presently he\r\ncame in sight again, looking like a little small bee--and he came along\r\ndown further and further, till he looked as big as a doll again--and down\r\nfurther and further, till he was as big as a boy again--and further and\r\nfurther, till he was a full-sized man once more; and then him and his\r\ncrowbar came a wh-izzing down and lit right exactly in the same old\r\ntracks and went to r-ramming down, and r-ramming down, and r-ramming down\r\nagain, just the same as if nothing had happened!  Now do you know, that\r\npoor cuss warn\'t gone only sixteen minutes, and yet that Incorporated\r\nCompany of Mean Men DOCKED HIM FOR THE LOST TIME!"\r\n\r\nI said I had the headache, and so excused myself and went home.  And on\r\nmy diary I entered "another night spoiled" by this offensive loafer.\r\nAnd a fervent curse was set down with it to keep the item company.  And\r\nthe very next day I packed up, out of all patience, and left the Island.\r\n\r\nAlmost from the very beginning, I regarded that man as a liar.\r\n\r\nThe line of points represents an interval of years.  At the end of which\r\ntime the opinion hazarded in that last sentence came to be gratifyingly\r\nand remarkably endorsed, and by wholly disinterested persons.  The man\r\nMarkiss was found one morning hanging to a beam of his own bedroom (the\r\ndoors and windows securely fastened on the inside), dead; and on his\r\nbreast was pinned a paper in his own handwriting begging his friends to\r\nsuspect no innocent person of having any thing to do with his death, for\r\nthat it was the work of his own hands entirely.  Yet the jury brought in\r\nthe astounding verdict that deceased came to his death "by the hands of\r\nsome person or persons unknown!"  They explained that the perfectly\r\nundeviating consistency of Markiss\'s character for thirty years towered\r\naloft as colossal and indestructible testimony, that whatever statement\r\nhe chose to make was entitled to instant and unquestioning acceptance as\r\na lie.  And they furthermore stated their belief that he was not dead,\r\nand instanced the strong circumstantial evidence of his own word that he\r\nwas dead--and beseeched the coroner to delay the funeral as long as\r\npossible, which was done.  And so in the tropical climate of Lahaina the\r\ncoffin stood open for seven days, and then even the loyal jury gave him\r\nup.  But they sat on him again, and changed their verdict to "suicide\r\ninduced by mental aberration"--because, said they, with penetration, "he\r\nsaid he was dead, and he was dead; and would he have told the truth if he\r\nhad been in his right mind?  No, sir."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVIII.\r\n\r\nAfter half a year\'s luxurious vagrancy in the islands, I took shipping in\r\na sailing vessel, and regretfully returned to San Francisco--a voyage in\r\nevery way delightful, but without an incident: unless lying two long\r\nweeks in a dead calm, eighteen hundred miles from the nearest land, may\r\nrank as an incident.  Schools of whales grew so tame that day after day\r\nthey played about the ship among the porpoises and the sharks without the\r\nleast apparent fear of us, and we pelted them with empty bottles for lack\r\nof better sport.  Twenty-four hours afterward these bottles would be\r\nstill lying on the glassy water under our noses, showing that the ship\r\nhad not moved out of her place in all that time.  The calm was absolutely\r\nbreathless, and the surface of the sea absolutely without a wrinkle.\r\nFor a whole day and part of a night we lay so close to another ship that\r\nhad drifted to our vicinity, that we carried on conversations with her\r\npassengers, introduced each other by name, and became pretty intimately\r\nacquainted with people we had never heard of before, and have never heard\r\nof since.  This was the only vessel we saw during the whole lonely\r\nvoyage.  We had fifteen passengers, and to show how hard pressed they\r\nwere at last for occupation and amusement, I will mention that the\r\ngentlemen gave a good part of their time every day, during the calm, to\r\ntrying to sit on an empty champagne bottle (lying on its side), and\r\nthread a needle without touching their heels to the deck, or falling\r\nover; and the ladies sat in the shade of the mainsail, and watched the\r\nenterprise with absorbing interest.  We were at sea five Sundays; and\r\nyet, but for the almanac, we never would have known but that all the\r\nother days were Sundays too.\r\n\r\nI was home again, in San Francisco, without means and without employment.\r\nI tortured my brain for a saving scheme of some kind, and at last a\r\npublic lecture occurred to me!  I sat down and wrote one, in a fever of\r\nhopeful anticipation.  I showed it to several friends, but they all shook\r\ntheir heads.  They said nobody would come to hear me, and I would make a\r\nhumiliating failure of it.\r\n\r\nThey said that as I had never spoken in public, I would break down in the\r\ndelivery, anyhow.  I was disconsolate now.  But at last an editor slapped\r\nme on the back and told me to "go ahead."  He said, "Take the largest\r\nhouse in town, and charge a dollar a ticket."  The audacity of the\r\nproposition was charming; it seemed fraught with practical worldly\r\nwisdom, however.  The proprietor of the several theatres endorsed the\r\nadvice, and said I might have his handsome new opera-house at half price\r\n--fifty dollars.  In sheer desperation I took it--on credit, for\r\nsufficient reasons.  In three days I did a hundred and fifty dollars\'\r\nworth of printing and advertising, and was the most distressed and\r\nfrightened creature on the Pacific coast.  I could not sleep--who could,\r\nunder such circumstances?  For other people there was facetiousness in\r\nthe last line of my posters, but to me it was plaintive with a pang when\r\nI wrote it:\r\n\r\n           "Doors open at 7 1/2.  The trouble will begin at 8."\r\n\r\nThat line has done good service since.  Showmen have borrowed it\r\nfrequently.  I have even seen it appended to a newspaper advertisement\r\nreminding school pupils in vacation what time next term would begin.  As\r\nthose three days of suspense dragged by, I grew more and more unhappy.\r\nI had sold two hundred tickets among my personal friends, but I feared\r\nthey might not come.  My lecture, which had seemed "humorous" to me, at\r\nfirst, grew steadily more and more dreary, till not a vestige of fun\r\nseemed left, and I grieved that I could not bring a coffin on the stage\r\nand turn the thing into a funeral.  I was so panic-stricken, at last,\r\nthat I went to three old friends, giants in stature, cordial by nature,\r\nand stormy-voiced, and said:\r\n\r\n"This thing is going to be a failure; the jokes in it are so dim that\r\nnobody will ever see them; I would like to have you sit in the parquette,\r\nand help me through."\r\n\r\nThey said they would.  Then I went to the wife of a popular citizen, and\r\nsaid that if she was willing to do me a very great kindness, I would be\r\nglad if she and her husband would sit prominently in the left-hand\r\nstage-box, where the whole house could see them.  I explained that I\r\nshould need help, and would turn toward her and smile, as a signal, when\r\nI had been delivered of an obscure joke--"and then," I added, "don\'t wait\r\nto investigate, but respond!"\r\n\r\nShe promised.  Down the street I met a man I never had seen before.  He\r\nhad been drinking, and was beaming with smiles and good nature.  He said:\r\n\r\n"My name\'s Sawyer.  You don\'t know me, but that don\'t matter.  I haven\'t\r\ngot a cent, but if you knew how bad I wanted to laugh, you\'d give me a\r\nticket.  Come, now, what do you say?"\r\n\r\n"Is your laugh hung on a hair-trigger?--that is, is it critical, or can\r\nyou get it off easy?"\r\n\r\nMy drawling infirmity of speech so affected him that he laughed a\r\nspecimen or two that struck me as being about the article I wanted, and I\r\ngave him a ticket, and appointed him to sit in the second circle, in the\r\ncentre, and be responsible for that division of the house.  I gave him\r\nminute instructions about how to detect indistinct jokes, and then went\r\naway, and left him chuckling placidly over the novelty of the idea.\r\n\r\nI ate nothing on the last of the three eventful days--I only suffered.\r\nI had advertised that on this third day the box-office would be opened\r\nfor the sale of reserved seats.  I crept down to the theater at four in\r\nthe afternoon to see if any sales had been made.  The ticket seller was\r\ngone, the box-office was locked up.  I had to swallow suddenly, or my\r\nheart would have got out.  "No sales," I said to myself; "I might have\r\nknown it."  I thought of suicide, pretended illness, flight.  I thought\r\nof these things in earnest, for I was very miserable and scared.  But of\r\ncourse I had to drive them away, and prepare to meet my fate.  I could\r\nnot wait for half-past seven--I wanted to face the horror, and end it\r\n--the feeling of many a man doomed to hang, no doubt.  I went down back\r\nstreets at six o\'clock, and entered the theatre by the back door.\r\nI stumbled my way in the dark among the ranks of canvas scenery, and\r\nstood on the stage.  The house was gloomy and silent, and its emptiness\r\ndepressing.  I went into the dark among the scenes again, and for an hour\r\nand a half gave myself up to the horrors, wholly unconscious of\r\neverything else.  Then I heard a murmur; it rose higher and higher, and\r\nended in a crash, mingled with cheers.  It made my hair raise, it was so\r\nclose to me, and so loud.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, and then another; presently came a third, and before I\r\nwell knew what I was about, I was in the middle of the stage, staring at\r\na sea of faces, bewildered by the fierce glare of the lights, and quaking\r\nin every limb with a terror that seemed like to take my life away.  The\r\nhouse was full, aisles and all!\r\n\r\nThe tumult in my heart and brain and legs continued a full minute before\r\nI could gain any command over myself.  Then I recognized the charity and\r\nthe friendliness in the faces before me, and little by little my fright\r\nmelted away, and I began to talk Within three or four minutes I was\r\ncomfortable, and even content.  My three chief allies, with three\r\nauxiliaries, were on hand, in the parquette, all sitting together, all\r\narmed with bludgeons, and all ready to make an onslaught upon the\r\nfeeblest joke that might show its head.  And whenever a joke did fall,\r\ntheir bludgeons came down and their faces seemed to split from ear to\r\near.\r\n\r\nSawyer, whose hearty countenance was seen looming redly in the centre of\r\nthe second circle, took it up, and the house was carried handsomely.\r\nInferior jokes never fared so royally before.  Presently I delivered a\r\nbit of serious matter with impressive unction (it was my pet), and the\r\naudience listened with an absorbed hush that gratified me more than any\r\napplause; and as I dropped the last word of the clause, I happened to\r\nturn and catch Mrs.--\'s intent and waiting eye; my conversation with her\r\nflashed upon me, and in spite of all I could do I smiled.  She took it\r\nfor the signal, and promptly delivered a mellow laugh that touched off\r\nthe whole audience; and the explosion that followed was the triumph of\r\nthe evening.  I thought that that honest man Sawyer would choke himself;\r\nand as for the bludgeons, they performed like pile-drivers.  But my poor\r\nlittle morsel of pathos was ruined.  It was taken in good faith as an\r\nintentional joke, and the prize one of the entertainment, and I wisely\r\nlet it go at that.\r\n\r\nAll the papers were kind in the morning; my appetite returned; I had a\r\nabundance of money.  All\'s well that ends well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIX.\r\n\r\nI launched out as a lecturer, now, with great boldness.  I had the field\r\nall to myself, for public lectures were almost an unknown commodity in\r\nthe Pacific market.  They are not so rare, now, I suppose.  I took an old\r\npersonal friend along to play agent for me, and for two or three weeks we\r\nroamed through Nevada and California and had a very cheerful time of it.\r\nTwo days before I lectured in Virginia City, two stagecoaches were robbed\r\nwithin two miles of the town.  The daring act was committed just at dawn,\r\nby six masked men, who sprang up alongside the coaches, presented\r\nrevolvers at the heads of the drivers and passengers, and commanded a\r\ngeneral dismount.  Everybody climbed down, and the robbers took their\r\nwatches and every cent they had.  Then they took gunpowder and blew up\r\nthe express specie boxes and got their contents.  The leader of the\r\nrobbers was a small, quick-spoken man, and the fame of his vigorous\r\nmanner and his intrepidity was in everybody\'s mouth when we arrived.\r\n\r\nThe night after instructing Virginia, I walked over the desolate "divide"\r\nand down to Gold Hill, and lectured there.  The lecture done, I stopped\r\nto talk with a friend, and did not start back till eleven.  The "divide"\r\nwas high, unoccupied ground, between the towns, the scene of twenty\r\nmidnight murders and a hundred robberies.  As we climbed up and stepped\r\nout on this eminence, the Gold Hill lights dropped out of sight at our\r\nbacks, and the night closed down gloomy and dismal.  A sharp wind swept\r\nthe place, too, and chilled our perspiring bodies through.\r\n\r\n"I tell you I don\'t like this place at night," said Mike the agent.\r\n\r\n"Well, don\'t speak so loud," I said.  "You needn\'t remind anybody that we\r\nare here."\r\n\r\nJust then a dim figure approached me from the direction of Virginia--a\r\nman, evidently.  He came straight at me, and I stepped aside to let him\r\npass; he stepped in the way and confronted me again.  Then I saw that he\r\nhad a mask on and was holding something in my face--I heard a click-click\r\nand recognized a revolver in dim outline.  I pushed the barrel aside with\r\nmy hand and said:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t!"\r\n\r\nHe ejaculated sharply:\r\n\r\n"Your watch!  Your money!"\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n"You can have them with pleasure--but take the pistol away from my face,\r\nplease.  It makes me shiver."\r\n\r\n"No remarks!  Hand out your money!"\r\n\r\n"Certainly--I--"\r\n\r\n"Put up your hands!  Don\'t you go for a weapon!  Put \'em up!  Higher!"\r\n\r\nI held them above my head.\r\n\r\nA pause.  Then:\r\n\r\n"Are you going to hand out your money or not?"\r\n\r\nI dropped my hands to my pockets and said:\r\n\r\n"Certainly!  I--"\r\n\r\n"Put up your hands!  Do you want your head blown off?  Higher!"\r\n\r\nI put them above my head again.\r\n\r\nAnother pause.\r\n\r\n"Are you going to hand out your money or not?  Ah-ah--again?  Put up your\r\nhands!  By George, you want the head shot off you awful bad!"\r\n\r\n"Well, friend, I\'m trying my best to please you.  You tell me to give up\r\nmy money, and when I reach for it you tell me to put up my hands.  If you\r\nwould only--.  Oh, now--don\'t!  All six of you at me!  That other man\r\nwill get away while.--Now please take some of those revolvers out of my\r\nface--do, if you please!  Every time one of them clicks, my liver comes\r\nup into my throat!  If you have a mother--any of you--or if any of you\r\nhave ever had a mother--or a--grandmother--or a--"\r\n\r\n"Cheese it!  Will you give up your money, or have we got to--.  There\r\n--there--none of that!  Put up your hands!"\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen--I know you are gentlemen by your--"\r\n\r\n"Silence!  If you want to be facetious, young man, there are times and\r\nplaces more fitting.  This is a serious business."\r\n\r\n"You prick the marrow of my opinion.  The funerals I have attended in my\r\ntime were comedies compared to it.  Now I think--"\r\n\r\n"Curse your palaver!  Your money!--your money!--your money!  Hold!--put\r\nup your hands!"\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, listen to reason.  You see how I am situated--now don\'t put\r\nthose pistols so close--I smell the powder.\r\n\r\n"You see how I am situated.  If I had four hands--so that I could hold up\r\ntwo and--"\r\n\r\n"Throttle him!  Gag him!  Kill him!"\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, don\'t!  Nobody\'s watching the other fellow.  Why don\'t some\r\nof you--.  Ouch!  Take it away, please!\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, you see that I\'ve got to hold up my hands; and so I can\'t take\r\nout my money--but if you\'ll be so kind as to take it out for me, I will\r\ndo as much for you some--"\r\n\r\n"Search him Beauregard--and stop his jaw with a bullet, quick, if he wags\r\nit again.  Help Beauregard, Stonewall."\r\n\r\nThen three of them, with the small, spry leader, adjourned to Mike and\r\nfell to searching him.  I was so excited that my lawless fancy tortured\r\nme to ask my two men all manner of facetious questions about their rebel\r\nbrother-generals of the South, but, considering the order they had\r\nreceived, it was but common prudence to keep still.  When everything had\r\nbeen taken from me,--watch, money, and a multitude of trifles of small\r\nvalue,--I supposed I was free, and forthwith put my cold hands into my\r\nempty pockets and began an inoffensive jig to warm my feet and stir up\r\nsome latent courage--but instantly all pistols were at my head, and the\r\norder came again:\r\n\r\nThey stood Mike up alongside of me, with strict orders to keep his hands\r\nabove his head, too, and then the chief highwayman said:\r\n\r\n"Beauregard, hide behind that boulder; Phil Sheridan, you hide behind\r\nthat other one; Stonewall Jackson, put yourself behind that sage-bush\r\nthere.  Keep your pistols bearing on these fellows, and if they take down\r\ntheir hands within ten minutes, or move a single peg, let them have it!"\r\n\r\nThen three disappeared in the gloom toward the several ambushes, and the\r\nother three disappeared down the road toward Virginia.\r\n\r\nIt was depressingly still, and miserably cold.  Now this whole thing was\r\na practical joke, and the robbers were personal friends of ours in\r\ndisguise, and twenty more lay hidden within ten feet of us during the\r\nwhole operation, listening.  Mike knew all this, and was in the joke, but\r\nI suspected nothing of it.  To me it was most uncomfortably genuine.\r\nWhen we had stood there in the middle of the road five minutes, like a\r\ncouple of idiots, with our hands aloft, freezing to death by inches,\r\nMike\'s interest in the joke began to wane.  He said:\r\n\r\n"The time\'s up, now, aint it?"\r\n\r\n"No, you keep still.  Do you want to take any chances with these bloody\r\nsavages?"\r\n\r\nPresently Mike said:\r\n\r\n"Now the time\'s up, anyway.  I\'m freezing."\r\n\r\n"Well freeze.  Better freeze than carry your brains home in a basket.\r\nMaybe the time is up, but how do we know?--got no watch to tell by.\r\nI mean to give them good measure.  I calculate to stand here fifteen\r\nminutes or die.  Don\'t you move."\r\n\r\nSo, without knowing it, I was making one joker very sick of his contract.\r\nWhen we took our arms down at last, they were aching with cold and\r\nfatigue, and when we went sneaking off, the dread I was in that the time\r\nmight not yet be up and that we would feel bullets in a moment, was not\r\nsufficient to draw all my attention from the misery that racked my\r\nstiffened body.\r\n\r\nThe joke of these highwayman friends of ours was mainly a joke upon\r\nthemselves; for they had waited for me on the cold hill-top two full\r\nhours before I came, and there was very little fun in that; they were so\r\nchilled that it took them a couple of weeks to get warm again.  Moreover,\r\nI never had a thought that they would kill me to get money which it was\r\nso perfectly easy to get without any such folly, and so they did not\r\nreally frighten me bad enough to make their enjoyment worth the trouble\r\nthey had taken.  I was only afraid that their weapons would go off\r\naccidentally.  Their very numbers inspired me with confidence that no\r\nblood would be intentionally spilled.  They were not smart; they ought to\r\nhave sent only one highwayman, with a double-barrelled shot gun, if they\r\ndesired to see the author of this volume climb a tree.\r\n\r\nHowever, I suppose that in the long run I got the largest share of the\r\njoke at last; and in a shape not foreseen by the highwaymen; for the\r\nchilly exposure on the "divide" while I was in a perspiration gave me a\r\ncold which developed itself into a troublesome disease and kept my hands\r\nidle some three months, besides costing me quite a sum in doctor\'s bills.\r\nSince then I play no practical jokes on people and generally lose my\r\ntemper when one is played upon me.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to San Francisco I projected a pleasure journey to Japan\r\nand thence westward around the world; but a desire to see home again\r\nchanged my mind, and I took a berth in the steamship, bade good-bye to\r\nthe friendliest land and livest, heartiest community on our continent,\r\nand came by the way of the Isthmus to New York--a trip that was not much\r\nof a pic-nic excursion, for the cholera broke out among us on the passage\r\nand we buried two or three bodies at sea every day.  I found home a\r\ndreary place after my long absence; for half the children I had known\r\nwere now wearing whiskers or waterfalls, and few of the grown people I\r\nhad been acquainted with remained at their hearthstones prosperous and\r\nhappy--some of them had wandered to other scenes, some were in jail, and\r\nthe rest had been hanged.  These changes touched me deeply, and I went\r\naway and joined the famous Quaker City European Excursion and carried my\r\ntears to foreign lands.\r\n\r\nThus, after seven years of vicissitudes, ended a "pleasure trip" to the\r\nsilver mines of Nevada which had originally been intended to occupy only\r\nthree months.  However, I usually miss my calculations further than that.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORAL.\r\n\r\nIf the reader thinks he is done, now, and that this book has no moral to\r\nit, he is in error.  The moral of it is this: If you are of any account,\r\nstay at home and make your way by faithful diligence; but if you are "no\r\naccount," go away from home, and then you will have to work, whether you\r\nwant to or not.  Thus you become a blessing to your friends by ceasing to\r\nbe a nuisance to them--if the people you go among suffer by the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX. A.\r\n\r\nBRIEF SKETCH OF MORMON HISTORY.\r\n\r\nMormonism is only about forty years old, but its career has been full of\r\nstir and adventure from the beginning, and is likely to remain so to the\r\nend.  Its adherents have been hunted and hounded from one end of the\r\ncountry to the other, and the result is that for years they have hated\r\nall "Gentiles" indiscriminately and with all their might.  Joseph Smith,\r\nthe finder of the Book of Mormon and founder of the religion, was driven\r\nfrom State to State with his mysterious copperplates and the miraculous\r\nstones he read their inscriptions with.  Finally he instituted his\r\n"church" in Ohio and Brigham Young joined it.  The neighbors began to\r\npersecute, and apostasy commenced.  Brigham held to the faith and worked\r\nhard.  He arrested desertion.  He did more--he added converts in the\r\nmidst of the trouble.  He rose in favor and importance with the brethren.\r\nHe was made one of the Twelve Apostles of the Church.  He shortly fought\r\nhis way to a higher post and a more powerful--President of the Twelve.\r\nThe neighbors rose up and drove the Mormons out of Ohio, and they settled\r\nin Missouri.  Brigham went with them.  The Missourians drove them out and\r\nthey retreated to Nauvoo, Illinois.  They prospered there, and built a\r\ntemple which made some pretensions to architectural grace and achieved\r\nsome celebrity in a section of country where a brick court-house with a\r\ntin dome and a cupola on it was contemplated with reverential awe.\r\nBut the Mormons were badgered and harried again by their neighbors.\r\nAll the proclamations Joseph Smith could issue denouncing polygamy and\r\nrepudiating it as utterly anti-Mormon were of no avail; the people of the\r\nneighborhood, on both sides of the Mississippi, claimed that polygamy was\r\npractised by the Mormons, and not only polygamy but a little of\r\neverything that was bad.  Brigham returned from a mission to England,\r\nwhere he had established a Mormon newspaper, and he brought back with him\r\nseveral hundred converts to his preaching.  His influence among the\r\nbrethren augmented with every move he made.  Finally Nauvoo was invaded\r\nby the Missouri and Illinois Gentiles, and Joseph Smith killed.  A Mormon\r\nnamed Rigdon assumed the Presidency of the Mormon church and government,\r\nin Smith\'s place, and even tried his hand at a prophecy or two.  But a\r\ngreater than he was at hand.  Brigham seized the advantage of the hour\r\nand without other authority than superior brain and nerve and will,\r\nhurled Rigdon from his high place and occupied it himself.  He did more.\r\nHe launched an elaborate curse at Rigdon and his disciples; and he\r\npronounced Rigdon\'s "prophecies" emanations from the devil, and ended by\r\n"handing the false prophet over to the buffetings of Satan for a thousand\r\nyears"--probably the longest term ever inflicted in Illinois.  The people\r\nrecognized their master.  They straightway elected Brigham Young\r\nPresident, by a prodigious majority, and have never faltered in their\r\ndevotion to him from that day to this.  Brigham had forecast--a quality\r\nwhich no other prominent Mormon has probably ever possessed.\r\nHe recognized that it was better to move to the wilderness than be moved.\r\nBy his command the people gathered together their meagre effects, turned\r\ntheir backs upon their homes, and their faces toward the wilderness, and\r\non a bitter night in February filed in sorrowful procession across the\r\nfrozen Mississippi, lighted on their way by the glare from their burning\r\ntemple, whose sacred furniture their own hands had fired!  They camped,\r\nseveral days afterward, on the western verge of Iowa, and poverty, want,\r\nhunger, cold, sickness, grief and persecution did their work, and many\r\nsuccumbed and died--martyrs, fair and true, whatever else they might have\r\nbeen.  Two years the remnant remained there, while Brigham and a small\r\nparty crossed the country and founded Great Salt Lake City, purposely\r\nchoosing a land which was outside the ownership and jurisdiction of the\r\nhated American nation.  Note that.  This was in 1847.  Brigham moved his\r\npeople there and got them settled just in time to see disaster fall\r\nagain.  For the war closed and Mexico ceded Brigham\'s refuge to the\r\nenemy--the United States!  In 1849 the Mormons organized a "free and\r\nindependent" government and erected the "State of Deseret," with Brigham\r\nYoung as its head.  But the very next year Congress deliberately snubbed\r\nit and created the "Territory of Utah" out of the same accumulation of\r\nmountains, sage-brush, alkali and general desolation,--but made Brigham\r\nGovernor of it.  Then for years the enormous migration across the plains\r\nto California poured through the land of the Mormons and yet the church\r\nremained staunch and true to its lord and master.  Neither hunger,\r\nthirst, poverty, grief, hatred, contempt, nor persecution could drive the\r\nMormons from their faith or their allegiance; and even the thirst for\r\ngold, which gleaned the flower of the youth and strength of many nations\r\nwas not able to entice them!  That was the final test.  An experiment\r\nthat could survive that was an experiment with some substance to it\r\nsomewhere.\r\n\r\nGreat Salt Lake City throve finely, and so did Utah.  One of the last\r\nthings which Brigham Young had done before leaving Iowa, was to appear in\r\nthe pulpit dressed to personate the worshipped and lamented prophet\r\nSmith, and confer the prophetic succession, with all its dignities,\r\nemoluments and authorities, upon "President Brigham Young!"  The people\r\naccepted the pious fraud with the maddest enthusiasm, and Brigham\'s power\r\nwas sealed and secured for all time.  Within five years afterward he\r\nopenly added polygamy to the tenets of the church by authority of a\r\n"revelation" which he pretended had been received nine years before by\r\nJoseph Smith, albeit Joseph is amply on record as denouncing polygamy to\r\nthe day of his death.\r\n\r\nNow was Brigham become a second Andrew Johnson in the small beginning and\r\nsteady progress of his official grandeur.  He had served successively as\r\na disciple in the ranks; home missionary; foreign missionary; editor and\r\npublisher; Apostle; President of the Board of Apostles; President of all\r\nMormondom, civil and ecclesiastical; successor to the great Joseph by the\r\nwill of heaven; "prophet," "seer," "revelator."  There was but one\r\ndignity higher which he could aspire to, and he reached out modestly and\r\ntook that--he proclaimed himself a God!\r\n\r\nHe claims that he is to have a heaven of his own hereafter, and that he\r\nwill be its God, and his wives and children its goddesses, princes and\r\nprincesses.  Into it all faithful Mormons will be admitted, with their\r\nfamilies, and will take rank and consequence according to the number of\r\ntheir wives and children.  If a disciple dies before he has had time to\r\naccumulate enough wives and children to enable him to be respectable in\r\nthe next world any friend can marry a few wives and raise a few children\r\nfor him after he is dead, and they are duly credited to his account and\r\nhis heavenly status advanced accordingly.\r\n\r\nLet it be borne in mind that the majority of the Mormons have always been\r\nignorant, simple, of an inferior order of intellect, unacquainted with\r\nthe world and its ways; and let it be borne in mind that the wives of\r\nthese Mormons are necessarily after the same pattern and their children\r\nlikely to be fit representatives of such a conjunction; and then let it\r\nbe remembered that for forty years these creatures have been driven,\r\ndriven, driven, relentlessly!  and mobbed, beaten, and shot down; cursed,\r\ndespised, expatriated; banished to a remote desert, whither they\r\njourneyed gaunt with famine and disease, disturbing the ancient solitudes\r\nwith their lamentations and marking the long way with graves of their\r\ndead--and all because they were simply trying to live and worship God in\r\nthe way which they believed with all their hearts and souls to be the\r\ntrue one.  Let all these things be borne in mind, and then it will not be\r\nhard to account for the deathless hatred which the Mormons bear our\r\npeople and our government.\r\n\r\nThat hatred has "fed fat its ancient grudge" ever since Mormon Utah\r\ndeveloped into a self-supporting realm and the church waxed rich and\r\nstrong.  Brigham as Territorial Governor made it plain that Mormondom was\r\nfor the Mormons.  The United States tried to rectify all that by\r\nappointing territorial officers from New England and other anti-Mormon\r\nlocalities, but Brigham prepared to make their entrance into his\r\ndominions difficult.  Three thousand United States troops had to go\r\nacross the plains and put these gentlemen in office.  And after they were\r\nin office they were as helpless as so many stone images.  They made laws\r\nwhich nobody minded and which could not be executed.  The federal judges\r\nopened court in a land filled with crime and violence and sat as holiday\r\nspectacles for insolent crowds to gape at--for there was nothing to try,\r\nnothing to do nothing on the dockets!  And if a Gentile brought a suit,\r\nthe Mormon jury would do just as it pleased about bringing in a verdict,\r\nand when the judgment of the court was rendered no Mormon cared for it\r\nand no officer could execute it.  Our Presidents shipped one cargo of\r\nofficials after another to Utah, but the result was always the same--they\r\nsat in a blight for awhile they fairly feasted on scowls and insults day\r\nby day, they saw every attempt to do their official duties find its\r\nreward in darker and darker looks, and in secret threats and warnings of\r\na more and more dismal nature--and at last they either succumbed and\r\nbecame despised tools and toys of the Mormons, or got scared and\r\ndiscomforted beyond all endurance and left the Territory.  If a brave\r\nofficer kept on courageously till his pluck was proven, some pliant\r\nBuchanan or Pierce would remove him and appoint a stick in his place.\r\nIn 1857 General Harney came very near being appointed Governor of Utah.\r\nAnd so it came very near being Harney governor and Cradlebaugh judge!\r\n--two men who never had any idea of fear further than the sort of murky\r\ncomprehension of it which they were enabled to gather from the\r\ndictionary.  Simply (if for nothing else) for the variety they would have\r\nmade in a rather monotonous history of Federal servility and\r\nhelplessness, it is a pity they were not fated to hold office together in\r\nUtah.\r\n\r\nUp to the date of our visit to Utah, such had been the Territorial\r\nrecord.  The Territorial government established there had been a hopeless\r\nfailure, and Brigham Young was the only real power in the land.  He was\r\nan absolute monarch--a monarch who defied our President--a monarch who\r\nlaughed at our armies when they camped about his capital--a monarch who\r\nreceived without emotion the news that the august Congress of the United\r\nStates had enacted a solemn law against polygamy, and then went forth\r\ncalmly and married twenty-five or thirty more wives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB.\r\nTHE MOUNTAIN MEADOWS MASSACRE.\r\n\r\nThe persecutions which the Mormons suffered so long--and which they\r\nconsider they still suffer in not being allowed to govern themselves\r\n--they have endeavored and are still endeavoring to repay.  The now almost\r\nforgotten "Mountain Meadows massacre" was their work.  It was very famous\r\nin its day.  The whole United States rang with its horrors.  A few items\r\nwill refresh the reader\'s memory.  A great emigrant train from Missouri\r\nand Arkansas passed through Salt Lake City and a few disaffected Mormons\r\njoined it for the sake of the strong protection it afforded for their\r\nescape.  In that matter lay sufficient cause for hot retaliation by the\r\nMormon chiefs.  Besides, these one hundred and forty-five or one hundred\r\nand fifty unsuspecting emigrants being in part from Arkansas, where a\r\nnoted Mormon missionary had lately been killed, and in part from\r\nMissouri, a State remembered with execrations as a bitter persecutor of\r\nthe saints when they were few and poor and friendless, here were\r\nsubstantial additional grounds for lack of love for these wayfarers.\r\nAnd finally, this train was rich, very rich in cattle, horses, mules and\r\nother property--and how could the Mormons consistently keep up their\r\ncoveted resemblance to the Israelitish tribes and not seize the "spoil"\r\nof an enemy when the Lord had so manifestly "delivered it into their\r\nhand?"\r\n\r\nWherefore, according to Mrs. C. V. Waite\'s entertaining book, "The Mormon\r\nProphet," it transpired that--\r\n\r\n"A \'revelation\' from Brigham Young, as Great Grand Archee or God, was\r\ndispatched to President J. C. Haight, Bishop Higbee and J. D. Lee\r\n(adopted son of Brigham), commanding them to raise all the forces they\r\ncould muster and trust, follow those cursed Gentiles (so read the\r\nrevelation), attack them disguised as Indians, and with the arrows of the\r\nAlmighty make a clean sweep of them, and leave none to tell the tale; and\r\nif they needed any assistance they were commanded to hire the Indians as\r\ntheir allies, promising them a share of the booty.  They were to be\r\nneither slothful nor negligent in their duty, and to be punctual in\r\nsending the teams back to him before winter set in, for this was the\r\nmandate of Almighty God."\r\n\r\nThe command of the "revelation" was faithfully obeyed.  A large party of\r\nMormons, painted and tricked out as Indians, overtook the train of\r\nemigrant wagons some three hundred miles south of Salt Lake City, and\r\nmade an attack.  But the emigrants threw up earthworks, made fortresses\r\nof their wagons and defended themselves gallantly and successfully for\r\nfive days!  Your Missouri or Arkansas gentleman is not much afraid of the\r\nsort of scurvy apologies for "Indians" which the southern part of Utah\r\naffords.  He would stand up and fight five hundred of them.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the five days the Mormons tried military strategy.  They\r\nretired to the upper end of the "Meadows," resumed civilized apparel,\r\nwashed off their paint, and then, heavily armed, drove down in wagons to\r\nthe beleaguered emigrants, bearing a flag of truce!  When the emigrants\r\nsaw white men coming they threw down their guns and welcomed them with\r\ncheer after cheer!  And, all unconscious of the poetry of it, no doubt,\r\nthey lifted a little child aloft, dressed in white, in answer to the flag\r\nof truce!\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the timely white "deliverers" were President Haight and\r\nBishop John D. Lee, of the Mormon Church.  Mr. Cradlebaugh, who served a\r\nterm as a Federal Judge in Utah and afterward was sent to Congress from\r\nNevada, tells in a speech delivered in Congress how these leaders next\r\nproceeded:\r\n\r\n"They professed to be on good terms with the Indians, and represented\r\nthem as being very mad.  They also proposed to intercede and settle the\r\nmatter with the Indians.  After several hours parley they, having\r\n(apparently) visited the Indians, gave the ultimatum of the savages;\r\nwhich was, that the emigrants should march out of their camp, leaving\r\neverything behind them, even their guns.  It was promised by the Mormon\r\nbishops that they would bring a force and guard the emigrants back to the\r\nsettlements.  The terms were agreed to, the emigrants being desirous of\r\nsaving the lives of their families.  The Mormons retired, and\r\nsubsequently appeared with thirty or forty armed men.  The emigrants were\r\nmarched out, the women and children in front and the men behind, the\r\nMormon guard being in the rear.  When they had marched in this way about\r\na mile, at a given signal the slaughter commenced.  The men were almost\r\nall shot down at the first fire from the guard.  Two only escaped, who\r\nfled to the desert, and were followed one hundred and fifty miles before\r\nthey were overtaken and slaughtered.  The women and children ran on, two\r\nor three hundred yards further, when they were overtaken and with the aid\r\nof the Indians they were slaughtered.  Seventeen individuals only, of all\r\nthe emigrant party, were spared, and they were little children, the\r\neldest of them being only seven years old.  Thus, on the 10th day of\r\nSeptember, 1857, was consummated one of the most cruel, cowardly and\r\nbloody murders known in our history."\r\n\r\nThe number of persons butchered by the Mormons on this occasion was one\r\nhundred and twenty.\r\n\r\nWith unheard-of temerity Judge Cradlebaugh opened his court and proceeded\r\nto make Mormondom answer for the massacre.  And what a spectacle it must\r\nhave been to see this grim veteran, solitary and alone in his pride and\r\nhis pluck, glowering down on his Mormon jury and Mormon auditory,\r\nderiding them by turns, and by turns "breathing threatenings and\r\nslaughter!"\r\n\r\nAn editorial in the Territorial Enterprise of that day says of him and of\r\nthe occasion:\r\n\r\n"He spoke and acted with the fearlessness and resolution of a Jackson;\r\nbut the jury failed to indict, or even report on the charges, while\r\nthreats of violence were heard in every quarter, and an attack on the\r\nU.S. troops intimated, if he persisted in his course.\r\n\r\n"Finding that nothing could be done with the juries, they were discharged\r\nwith a scathing rebuke from the judge.  And then, sitting as a committing\r\nmagistrate, he commenced his task alone.  He examined witnesses, made\r\narrests in every quarter, and created a consternation in the camps of the\r\nsaints greater than any they had ever witnessed before, since Mormondom\r\nwas born.  At last accounts terrified elders and bishops were decamping\r\nto save their necks; and developments of the most starling character were\r\nbeing made, implicating the highest Church dignitaries in the many\r\nmurders and robberies committed upon the Gentiles during the past eight\r\nyears."\r\n\r\nHad Harney been Governor, Cradlebaugh would have been supported in his\r\nwork, and the absolute proofs adduced by him of Mormon guilt in this\r\nmassacre and in a number of previous murders, would have conferred\r\ngratuitous coffins upon certain citizens, together with occasion to use\r\nthem.  But Cumming was the Federal Governor, and he, under a curious\r\npretense of impartiality, sought to screen the Mormons from the demands\r\nof justice.  On one occasion he even went so far as to publish his\r\nprotest against the use of the U.S. troops in aid of Cradlebaugh\'s\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nMrs. C. V. Waite closes her interesting detail of the great massacre with\r\nthe following remark and accompanying summary of the testimony--and the\r\nsummary is concise, accurate and reliable:\r\n\r\n"For the benefit of those who may still be disposed to doubt the guilt of\r\nYoung and his Mormons in this transaction, the testimony is here collated\r\nand circumstances given which go not merely to implicate but to fasten\r\nconviction upon them by \'confirmations strong as proofs of Holy Writ:\'\r\n\r\n"1.  The evidence of Mormons themselves, engaged in the affair, as shown\r\nby the statements of Judge Cradlebaugh and Deputy U.S.  Marshall Rodgers.\r\n\r\n"2.  The failure of Brigham Young to embody any account of it in his\r\nReport as Superintendent of Indian Affairs.  Also his failure to make any\r\nallusion to it whatever from the pulpit, until several years after the\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\n"3.  The flight to the mountains of men high in authority in the Mormon\r\nChurch and State, when this affair was brought to the ordeal of a\r\njudicial investigation.\r\n\r\n"4.  The failure of the Deseret News, the Church organ, and the only\r\npaper then published in the Territory, to notice the massacre until\r\nseveral months afterward, and then only to deny that Mormons were engaged\r\nin it.\r\n\r\n"5.  The testimony of the children saved from the massacre.\r\n\r\n"6.  The children and the property of the emigrants found in possession\r\nof the Mormons, and that possession traced back to the very day after the\r\nmassacre.\r\n\r\n"7.  The statements of Indians in the neighborhood of the scene of the\r\nmassacre: these statements are shown, not only by Cradlebaugh and\r\nRodgers, but by a number of military officers, and by J. Forney, who was,\r\nin 1859, Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Territory.  To all\r\nthese were such statements freely and frequently made by the Indians.\r\n\r\n"8.  The testimony of R. P. Campbell, Capt.  2d Dragoons, who was sent in\r\nthe Spring of 1859 to Santa Clara, to protect travelers on the road to\r\nCalifornia and to inquire into Indian depredations."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC.\r\nCONCERNING A FRIGHTFUL ASSASSINATION THAT WAS NEVER CONSUMMATED\r\n\r\nIf ever there was a harmless man, it is Conrad Wiegand, of Gold Hill,\r\nNevada.  If ever there was a gentle spirit that thought itself unfired\r\ngunpowder and latent ruin, it is Conrad Wiegand.  If ever there was an\r\noyster that fancied itself a whale; or a jack-o\'lantern, confined to a\r\nswamp, that fancied itself a planet with a billion-mile orbit; or a\r\nsummer zephyr that deemed itself a hurricane, it is Conrad Wiegand.\r\nTherefore, what wonder is it that when he says a thing, he thinks the\r\nworld listens; that when he does a thing the world stands still to look;\r\nand that when he suffers, there is a convulsion of nature?  When I met\r\nConrad, he was "Superintendent of the Gold Hill Assay Office"--and he was\r\nnot only its Superintendent, but its entire force.  And he was a street\r\npreacher, too, with a mongrel religion of his own invention, whereby he\r\nexpected to regenerate the universe.  This was years ago.  Here latterly\r\nhe has entered journalism; and his journalism is what it might be\r\nexpected to be: colossal to ear, but pigmy to the eye.  It is extravagant\r\ngrandiloquence confined to a newspaper about the size of a double letter\r\nsheet.  He doubtless edits, sets the type, and prints his paper, all\r\nalone; but he delights to speak of the concern as if it occupies a block\r\nand employs a thousand men.\r\n\r\n[Something less than two years ago, Conrad assailed several people\r\nmercilessly in his little "People\'s Tribune," and got himself into\r\ntrouble.  Straightway he airs the affair in the "Territorial Enterprise,"\r\nin a communication over his own signature, and I propose to reproduce it\r\nhere, in all its native simplicity and more than human candor.  Long as\r\nit is, it is well worth reading, for it is the richest specimen of\r\njournalistic literature the history of America can furnish, perhaps:]\r\n\r\nFrom the Territorial Enterprise, Jan. 20, 1870.\r\n\r\nSEEMING PLOT FOR ASSASSINATION MISCARRIED.\r\n\r\nTO THE EDITOR OF THE ENTERPRISE: Months ago, when Mr. Sutro incidentally\r\nexposed mining management on the Comstock, and among others roused me to\r\nprotest against its continuance, in great kindness you warned me that any\r\nattempt by publications, by public meetings and by legislative action,\r\naimed at the correction of chronic mining evils in Storey County, must\r\nentail upon me (a) business ruin, (b) the burden of all its costs, (c)\r\npersonal violence, and if my purpose were persisted in, then (d)\r\nassassination, and after all nothing would be effected.\r\n\r\nYOUR PROPHECY FULFILLING.\r\nIn large part at least your prophecies have been fulfilled, for (a)\r\nassaying, which was well attended to in the Gold Hill Assay Office (of\r\nwhich I am superintendent), in consequence of my publications, has been\r\ntaken elsewhere, so the President of one of the companies assures me.\r\nWith no reason assigned, other work has been taken away.  With but one or\r\ntwo important exceptions, our assay business now consists simply of the\r\ngleanings of the vicinity.  (b) Though my own personal donations to the\r\nPeople\'s Tribune Association have already exceeded $1,500, outside of our\r\nown numbers we have received (in money) less than $300 as contributions\r\nand subscriptions for the journal.  (c) On Thursday last, on the main\r\nstreet in Gold Hill, near noon, with neither warning nor cause assigned,\r\nby a powerful blow I was felled to the ground, and while down I was\r\nkicked by a man who it would seem had been led to believe that I had\r\nspoken derogatorily of him.  By whom he was so induced to believe I am as\r\nyet unable to say.  On Saturday last I was again assailed and beaten by a\r\nman who first informed me why he did so, and who persisted in making his\r\nassault even after the erroneous impression under which he also was at\r\nfirst laboring had been clearly and repeatedly pointed out.  This same\r\nman, after failing through intimidation to elicit from me the names of\r\nour editorial contributors, against giving which he knew me to be\r\npledged, beat himself weary upon me with a raw hide, I not resisting, and\r\nthen pantingly threatened me with permanent disfiguring mayhem, if ever\r\nagain I should introduce his name into print, and who but a few minutes\r\nbefore his attack upon me assured me that the only reason I was\r\n"permitted" to reach home alive on Wednesday evening last (at which time\r\nthe PEOPLE\'S TRIBUNE was issued) was, that he deems me only half-witted,\r\nand be it remembered the very next morning I was knocked down and kicked\r\nby a man who seemed to be prepared for flight.\r\n\r\n[He sees doom impending:]\r\n\r\nWHEN WILL THE CIRCLE JOIN?\r\nHow long before the whole of your prophecy will be fulfilled I cannot\r\nsay, but under the shadow of so much fulfillment in so short a time, and\r\nwith such threats from a man who is one of the most prominent exponents\r\nof the San Francisco mining-ring staring me and this whole community\r\ndefiantly in the face and pointing to a completion of your augury, do you\r\nblame me for feeling that this communication is the last I shall ever\r\nwrite for the Press, especially when a sense alike of personal\r\nself-respect, of duty to this money-oppressed and fear-ridden community,\r\nand of American fealty to the spirit of true Liberty all command me, and\r\neach more loudly than love of life itself, to declare the name of that\r\nprominent man to be JOHN B. WINTERS, President of the Yellow Jacket\r\nCompany, a political aspirant and a military General?  The name of his\r\npartially duped accomplice and abettor in this last marvelous assault, is\r\nno other than PHILIP LYNCH, Editor and Proprietor of the Gold Hill News.\r\n\r\nDespite the insult and wrong heaped upon me by John B. Winters, on\r\nSaturday afternoon, only a glimpse of which I shall be able to afford\r\nyour readers, so much do I deplore clinching (by publicity) a serious\r\nmistake of any one, man or woman, committed under natural and not\r\nself-wrought passion, in view of his great apparent excitement at the\r\ntime and in view of the almost perfect privacy of the assault, I am far\r\nfrom sure that I should not have given him space for repentance before\r\nexposing him, were it not that he himself has so far exposed the matter\r\nas to make it the common talk of the town that he has horsewhipped me.\r\nThat fact having been made public, all the facts in connection need to be\r\nalso, or silence on my part would seem more than singular, and with many\r\nwould be proof either that I was conscious of some unworthy aim in\r\npublishing the article, or else that my "non-combatant" principles are\r\nbut a convenient cloak alike of physical and moral cowardice.  I\r\ntherefore shall try to present a graphic but truthful picture of this\r\nwhole affair, but shall forbear all comments, presuming that the editors\r\nof our own journal, if others do not, will speak freely and fittingly\r\nupon this subject in our next number, whether I shall then be dead or\r\nliving, for my death will not stop, though it may suspend, the\r\npublication of the PEOPLE\'S TRIBUNE. [The "non-combatant" sticks to\r\nprinciple, but takes along a friend or two of a conveniently different\r\nstripe:]\r\n\r\nTHE TRAP SET.\r\nOn Saturday morning John B. Winters sent verbal word to the Gold Hill\r\nAssay Office that he desired to see me at the Yellow Jacket office.\r\nThough such a request struck me as decidedly cool in view of his own\r\nrecent discourtesies to me there alike as a publisher and as a\r\nstockholder in the Yellow Jacket mine, and though it seemed to me more\r\nlike a summons than the courteous request by one gentleman to another for\r\na favor, hoping that some conference with Sharon looking to the\r\nbetterment of mining matters in Nevada might arise from it, I felt\r\nstrongly inclined to overlook what possibly was simply an oversight in\r\ncourtesy.  But as then it had only been two days since I had been bruised\r\nand beaten under a hasty and false apprehension of facts, my caution was\r\nsomewhat aroused.  Moreover I remembered sensitively his contemptuousness\r\nof manner to me at my last interview in his office.  I therefore felt it\r\nneedful, if I went at all, to go accompanied by a friend whom he would\r\nnot dare to treat with incivility, and whose presence with me might\r\nsecure exemption from insult.  Accordingly I asked a neighbor to\r\naccompany me.\r\n\r\nTHE TRAP ALMOST DETECTED.\r\nAlthough I was not then aware of this fact, it would seem that previous\r\nto my request this same neighbor had heard Dr. Zabriskie state publicly\r\nin a saloon, that Mr. Winters had told him he had decided either to kill\r\nor to horsewhip me, but had not finally decided on which.  My neighbor,\r\ntherefore, felt unwilling to go down with me until he had first called on\r\nMr. Winters alone.  He therefore paid him a visit.  From that interview\r\nhe assured me that he gathered the impression that he did not believe I\r\nwould have any difficulty with Mr. Winters, and that he (Winters) would\r\ncall on me at four o\'clock in my own office.\r\n\r\nMY OWN PRECAUTIONS.\r\nAs Sheriff Cummings was in Gold Hill that afternoon, and as I desired to\r\nconverse with him about the previous assault, I invited him to my office,\r\nand he came.  Although a half hour had passed beyond four o\'clock, Mr.\r\nWinters had not called, and we both of us began preparing to go home.\r\nJust then, Philip Lynch, Publisher of the Gold Hill News, came in and\r\nsaid, blandly and cheerily, as if bringing good news:\r\n\r\n"Hello, John B. Winters wants to see you."\r\n\r\nI replied, "Indeed!  Why he sent me word that he would call on me here\r\nthis afternoon at four o\'clock!"\r\n\r\n"O, well, it don\'t do to be too ceremonious just now, he\'s in my office,\r\nand that will do as well--come on in, Winters wants to consult with you\r\nalone.  He\'s got something to say to you."\r\n\r\nThough slightly uneasy at this change of programme, yet believing that in\r\nan editor\'s house I ought to be safe, and anyhow that I would be within\r\nhail of the street, I hurriedly, and but partially whispered my dim\r\napprehensions to Mr. Cummings, and asked him if he would not keep near\r\nenough to hear my voice in case I should call.  He consented to do so\r\nwhile waiting for some other parties, and to come in if he heard my voice\r\nor thought I had need of protection.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the editorial part of the News office, which viewed from the\r\nstreet is dark, I did not see Mr. Winters, and again my misgivings arose.\r\nHad I paused long enough to consider the case, I should have invited\r\nSheriff Cummings in, but as Lynch went down stairs, he said: "This way,\r\nWiegand--it\'s best to be private," or some such remark.\r\n\r\n[I do not desire to strain the reader\'s fancy, hurtfully, and yet it\r\nwould be a favor to me if he would try to fancy this lamb in battle, or\r\nthe duelling ground or at the head of a vigilance committee--M.  T.:]\r\n\r\nI followed, and without Mr. Cummings, and without arms, which I never do\r\nor will carry, unless as a soldier in war, or unless I should yet come to\r\nfeel I must fight a duel, or to join and aid in the ranks of a necessary\r\nVigilance Committee.  But by following I made a fatal mistake.  Following\r\nwas entering a trap, and whatever animal suffers itself to be caught\r\nshould expect the common fate of a caged rat, as I fear events to come\r\nwill prove.\r\n\r\nTraps commonly are not set for benevolence.\r\n[His body-guard is shut out:]\r\n\r\nTHE TRAP INSIDE.\r\nI followed Lynch down stairs.  At their foot a door to the left opened\r\ninto a small room.  From that room another door opened into yet another\r\nroom, and once entered I found myself inveigled into what many will ever\r\nhenceforth regard as a private subterranean Gold Hill den, admirably\r\nadapted in proper hands to the purposes of murder, raw or disguised, for\r\nfrom it, with both or even one door closed, when too late, I saw that I\r\ncould not be heard by Sheriff Cummings, and from it, BY VIOLENCE AND BY\r\nFORCE, I was prevented from making a peaceable exit, when I thought I saw\r\nthe studious object of this "consultation" was no other than to compass\r\nmy killing, in the presence of Philip Lynch as a witness, as soon as by\r\ninsult a proverbially excitable man should be exasperated to the point of\r\nassailing Mr. Winters, so that Mr. Lynch, by his conscience and by his\r\nwell known tenderness of heart toward the rich and potent would be\r\ncompelled to testify that he saw Gen. John B. Winters kill Conrad Wiegand\r\nin "self-defence."  But I am going too fast.\r\n\r\nOUR HOST.\r\nMr. Lynch was present during the most of the time (say a little short of\r\nan hour), but three times he left the room.  His testimony, therefore,\r\nwould be available only as to the bulk of what transpired.  On entering\r\nthis carpeted den I was invited to a seat near one corner of the room.\r\nMr. Lynch took a seat near the window.  J. B. Winters sat (at first) near\r\nthe door, and began his remarks essentially as follows:\r\n\r\n"I have come here to exact of you a retraction, in black and white, of\r\nthose damnably false charges which you have preferred against me in\r\nthat---infamous lying sheet of yours, and you must declare yourself their\r\nauthor, that you published them knowing them to be false, and that your\r\nmotives were malicious."\r\n\r\n"Hold, Mr. Winters.  Your language is insulting and your demand an\r\nenormity.  I trust I was not invited here either to be insulted or\r\ncoerced.  I supposed myself here by invitation of Mr. Lynch, at your\r\nrequest."\r\n\r\n"Nor did I come here to insult you.  I have already told you that I am\r\nhere for a very different purpose."\r\n\r\n"Yet your language has been offensive, and even now shows strong\r\nexcitement.  If insult is repeated I shall either leave the room or call\r\nin Sheriff Cummings, whom I just left standing and waiting for me outside\r\nthe door."\r\n\r\n"No, you won\'t, sir.  You may just as well understand it at once as not.\r\nHere you are my man, and I\'ll tell you why!  Months ago you put your\r\nproperty out of your hands, boasting that you did so to escape losing it\r\non prosecution for libel."\r\n\r\n"It is true that I did convert all my immovable property into personal\r\nproperty, such as I could trust safely to others, and chiefly to escape\r\nruin through possible libel suits."\r\n\r\n"Very good, sir.  Having placed yourself beyond the pale of the law, may\r\nGod help your soul if you DON\'T make precisely such a retraction as I\r\nhave demanded.  I\'ve got you now, and by--before you can get out of this\r\nroom you\'ve got to both write and sign precisely the retraction I have\r\ndemanded, and before you go, anyhow--you---low-lived--lying---, I\'ll\r\nteach you what personal responsibility is outside of the law; and, by--,\r\nSheriff Cummings and all the friends you\'ve got in the world besides,\r\ncan\'t save you, you---, etc.!  No, sir.  I\'m alone now, and I\'m prepared\r\nto be shot down just here and now rather than be villified by you as I\r\nhave been, and suffer you to escape me after publishing those charges,\r\nnot only here where I am known and universally respected, but where I am\r\nnot personally known and may be injured."\r\n\r\nI confess this speech, with its terrible and but too plainly implied\r\nthreat of killing me if I did not sign the paper he demanded, terrified\r\nme, especially as I saw he was working himself up to the highest possible\r\npitch of passion, and instinct told me that any reply other than one of\r\nseeming concession to his demands would only be fuel to a raging fire,\r\nso I replied:\r\n\r\n"Well, if I\'ve got to sign--," and then I paused some time.  Resuming,\r\nI said, "But, Mr. Winters, you are greatly excited.  Besides, I see you\r\nare laboring under a total misapprehension.  It is your duty not to\r\ninflame but to calm yourself.  I am prepared to show you, if you will\r\nonly point out the article that you allude to, that you regard as\r\n\'charges\' what no calm and logical mind has any right to regard as such.\r\nShow me the charges, and I will try, at all events; and if it becomes\r\nplain that no charges have been preferred, then plainly there can be\r\nnothing to retract, and no one could rightly urge you to demand a\r\nretraction.  You should beware of making so serious a mistake, for\r\nhowever honest a man may be, every one is liable to misapprehend.\r\nBesides you assume that I am the author of some certain article which you\r\nhave not pointed out.  It is hasty to do so."\r\n\r\nHe then pointed to some numbered paragraphs in a TRIBUNE article, headed\r\n"What\'s the Matter with Yellow Jacket?" saying "That\'s what I refer to."\r\n\r\nTo gain time for general reflection and resolution, I took up the paper\r\nand looked it over for awhile, he remaining silent, and as I hoped,\r\ncooling.  I then resumed saying, "As I supposed.  I do not admit having\r\nwritten that article, nor have you any right to assume so important a\r\npoint, and then base important action upon your assumption.  You might\r\ndeeply regret it afterwards.  In my published Address to the People, I\r\nnotified the world that no information as to the authorship of any\r\narticle would be given without the consent of the writer.  I therefore\r\ncannot honorably tell you who wrote that article, nor can you exact it."\r\n\r\n"If you are not the author, then I do demand to know who is?"\r\n\r\n"I must decline to say."\r\n\r\n"Then, by--, I brand you as its author, and shall treat you accordingly."\r\n\r\n"Passing that point, the most important misapprehension which I notice\r\nis, that you regard them as \'charges\' at all, when their context, both at\r\ntheir beginning and end, show they are not.  These words introduce them:\r\n\'Such an investigation [just before indicated], we think MIGHT result in\r\nshowing some of the following points.\' Then follow eleven specifications,\r\nand the succeeding paragraph shows that the suggested investigation\r\n\'might EXONERATE those who are generally believed guilty.\' You see,\r\ntherefore, the context proves they are not preferred as charges, and this\r\nyou seem to have overlooked."\r\n\r\nWhile making those comments, Mr. Winters frequently interrupted me in\r\nsuch a way as to convince me that he was resolved not to consider\r\ncandidly the thoughts contained in my words.  He insisted upon it that\r\nthey were charges, and "By--," he would make me take them back as\r\ncharges, and he referred the question to Philip Lynch, to whom I then\r\nappealed as a literary man, as a logician, and as an editor, calling his\r\nattention especially to the introductory paragraph just before quoted.\r\nHe replied, "if they are not charges, they certainly are insinuations,"\r\nwhereupon Mr. Winters renewed his demands for retraction precisely such\r\nas he had before named, except that he would allow me to state who did\r\nwrite the article if I did not myself, and this time shaking his fist in\r\nmy face with more cursings and epithets.\r\n\r\nWhen he threatened me with his clenched fist, instinctively I tried to\r\nrise from my chair, but Winters then forcibly thrust me down, as he did\r\nevery other time (at least seven or eight), when under similar imminent\r\ndanger of bruising by his fist (or for aught I could know worse than that\r\nafter the first stunning blow), which he could easily and safely to\r\nhimself have dealt me so long as he kept me down and stood over me.\r\n\r\nThis fact it was, which more than anything else, convinced me that by\r\nplan and plot I was purposely made powerless in Mr. Winters\' hands, and\r\nthat he did not mean to allow me that advantage of being afoot, which he\r\npossessed.  Moreover, I then became convinced, that Philip Lynch (and for\r\nwhat reason I wondered) would do absolutely nothing to protect me in his\r\nown house.  I realized then the situation thoroughly.  I had found it\r\nequally vain to protest or argue, and I would make no unmanly appeal for\r\npity, still less apologize.  Yet my life had been by the plainest\r\npossible implication threatened.  I was a weak man.  I was unarmed.  I\r\nwas helplessly down, and Winters was afoot and probably armed.  Lynch was\r\nthe only "witness."  The statements demanded, if given and not explained,\r\nwould utterly sink me in my own self-respect, in my family\'s eyes, and in\r\nthe eyes of the community.  On the other hand, should I give the author\'s\r\nname how could I ever expect that confidence of the People which I should\r\nno longer deserve, and how much dearer to me and to my family was my life\r\nthan the life of the real author to his friends.  Yet life seemed dear\r\nand each minute that remained seemed precious if not solemn.  I sincerely\r\ntrust that neither you nor any of your readers, and especially none with\r\nfamilies, may ever be placed in such seeming direct proximity to death\r\nwhile obliged to decide the one question I was compelled to, viz.: What\r\nshould I do--I, a man of family, and not as Mr. Winters is, "alone."\r\n[The reader is requested not to skip the following.--M.  T.:]\r\n\r\nSTRATEGY AND MESMERISM.\r\nTo gain time for further reflection, and hoping that by a seeming\r\nacquiescence I might regain my personal liberty, at least till I could\r\ngive an alarm, or take advantage of some momentary inadvertence of\r\nWinters, and then without a cowardly flight escape, I resolved to write a\r\ncertain kind of retraction, but previously had inwardly decided:\r\n\r\nFirst.--That I would studiously avoid every action which might be\r\nconstrued into the drawing of a weapon, even by a self-infuriated man, no\r\nmatter what amount of insult might be heaped upon me, for it seemed to me\r\nthat this great excess of compound profanity, foulness and epithet must\r\nbe more than a mere indulgence, and therefore must have some object.\r\n"Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird."  Therefore,\r\nas before without thought, I thereafter by intent kept my hands away from\r\nmy pockets, and generally in sight and spread upon my knees.\r\n\r\nSecond.--I resolved to make no motion with my arms or hands which could\r\npossibly be construed into aggression.\r\n\r\nThird.--I resolved completely to govern my outward manner and suppress\r\nindignation.  To do this, I must govern my spirit.  To do that, by force\r\nof imagination I was obliged like actors on the boards to resolve myself\r\ninto an unnatural mental state and see all things through the eyes of an\r\nassumed character.\r\n\r\nFourth.--I resolved to try on Winters, silently, and unconsciously to\r\nhimself a mesmeric power which I possess over certain kinds of people,\r\nand which at times I have found to work even in the dark over the lower\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nDoes any one smile at these last counts?  God save you from ever being\r\nobliged to beat in a game of chess, whose stake is your life, you having\r\nbut four poor pawns and pieces and your adversary with his full force\r\nunshorn.  But if you are, provided you have any strength with breadth of\r\nwill, do not despair.  Though mesmeric power may not save you, it may\r\nhelp you; try it at all events.  In this instance I was conscious of\r\npower coming into me, and by a law of nature, I know Winters was\r\ncorrespondingly weakened.  If I could have gained more time I am sure he\r\nwould not even have struck me.\r\n\r\nIt takes time both to form such resolutions and to recite them.  That\r\ntime, however, I gained while thinking of my retraction, which I first\r\nwrote in pencil, altering it from time to time till I got it to suit me,\r\nmy aim being to make it look like a concession to demands, while in fact\r\nit should tersely speak the truth into Mr. Winters\' mind.  When it was\r\nfinished, I copied it in ink, and if correctly copied from my first draft\r\nit should read as follows.  In copying I do not think I made any material\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nCOPY.\r\nTo Philip Lynch, Editor of the Gold Hill News: I learn that Gen. John B.\r\nWinters believes the following (pasted on) clipping from the PEOPLE\'S\r\nTRIBUNE of January to contain distinct charges of mine against him\r\npersonally, and that as such he desires me to retract them unqualifiedly.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with his request, permit me to say that, although Mr.\r\nWinters and I see this matter differently, in view of his strong feelings\r\nin the premises, I hereby declare that I do not know those "charges" (if\r\nsuch they are) to be true, and I hope that a critical examination would\r\naltogether disprove them.\r\n                              CONRAD WIEGAND.\r\n                         Gold Hill, January 15, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\nI then read what I had written and handed it to Mr. Lynch, whereupon Mr.\r\nWinters said:\r\n\r\n"That\'s not satisfactory, and it won\'t do;" and then addressing himself\r\nto Mr. Lynch, he further said: "How does it strike you?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I confess I don\'t see that it retracts anything."\r\n\r\n"Nor do I," said Winters; "in fact, I regard it as adding insult to\r\ninjury.  Mr. Wiegand you\'ve got to do better than that.  You are not the\r\nman who can pull wool over my eyes."\r\n\r\n"That, sir, is the only retraction I can write."\r\n\r\n"No it isn\'t, sir, and if you so much as say so again you do it at your\r\nperil, for I\'ll thrash you to within an inch of your life, and, by--,\r\nsir, I don\'t pledge myself to spare you even that inch either.  I want\r\nyou to understand I have asked you for a very different paper, and that\r\npaper you\'ve got to sign."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Winters, I assure you that I do not wish to irritate you, but, at\r\nthe same time, it is utterly impossible for me to write any other paper\r\nthan that which I have written.  If you are resolved to compel me to sign\r\nsomething, Philip Lynch\'s hand must write at your dictation, and if, when\r\nwritten, I can sign it I will do so, but such a document as you say you\r\nmust have from me, I never can sign.  I mean what I say."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, what\'s to be done must be done quickly, for I\'ve been here\r\nlong enough already.  I\'ll put the thing in another shape (and then\r\npointing to the paper); don\'t you know those charges to be false?"\r\n\r\n"I do not."\r\n\r\n"Do you know them to be true?"\r\n\r\n"Of my own personal knowledge I do not."\r\n\r\n"Why then did you print them?"\r\n\r\n"Because rightly considered in their connection they are not charges, but\r\npertinent and useful suggestions in answer to the queries of a\r\ncorrespondent who stated facts which are inexplicable."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know that I know they are false?"\r\n\r\n"If you do, the proper course is simply to deny them and court an\r\ninvestigation."\r\n\r\n"And do YOU claim the right to make ME come out and deny anything you may\r\nchoose to write and print?"\r\n\r\nTo that question I think I made no reply, and he then further said:\r\n\r\n"Come, now, we\'ve talked about the matter long enough.  I want your final\r\nanswer--did you write that article or not?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot in honor tell you who wrote it."\r\n\r\n"Did you not see it before it was printed?"\r\n\r\n"Most certainly, sir."\r\n\r\n"And did you deem it a fit thing to publish?"\r\n\r\n"Most assuredly, sir, or I would never have consented to its appearance.\r\nOf its authorship I can say nothing whatever, but for its publication I\r\nassume full, sole and personal responsibility."\r\n\r\n"And do you then retract it or not?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Winters, if my refusal to sign such a paper as you have demanded\r\nmust entail upon me all that your language in this room fairly implies,\r\nthen I ask a few minutes for prayer."\r\n\r\n"Prayer!---you, this is not your hour for prayer--your time to pray was\r\nwhen you were writing those--lying charges.  Will you sign or not?"\r\n\r\n"You already have my answer."\r\n\r\n"What!  do you still refuse?"\r\n\r\n"I do, sir."\r\n\r\n"Take that, then," and to my amazement and inexpressible relief he drew\r\nonly a rawhide instead of what I expected--a bludgeon or pistol.  With\r\nit, as he spoke, he struck at my left ear downwards, as if to tear it\r\noff, and afterwards on the side of the head.  As he moved away to get a\r\nbetter chance for a more effective shot, for the first time I gained a\r\nchance under peril to rise, and I did so pitying him from the very bottom\r\nof my soul, to think that one so naturally capable of true dignity, power\r\nand nobility could, by the temptations of this State, and by unfortunate\r\nassociations and aspirations, be so deeply debased as to find in such\r\nbrutality anything which he could call satisfaction--but the great hope\r\nfor us all is in progress and growth, and John B.  Winters, I trust, will\r\nyet be able to comprehend my feelings.\r\n\r\nHe continued to beat me with all his great force, until absolutely weary,\r\nexhausted and panting for breath.  I still adhered to my purpose of\r\nnon-aggressive defence, and made no other use of my arms than to defend\r\nmy head and face from further disfigurement.  The mere pain arising from\r\nthe blows he inflicted upon my person was of course transient, and my\r\nclothing to some extent deadened its severity, as it now hides all\r\nremaining traces.\r\n\r\nWhen I supposed he was through, taking the butt end of his weapon and\r\nshaking it in my face, he warned me, if I correctly understood him, of\r\nmore yet to come, and furthermore said, if ever I again dared introduce\r\nhis name to print, in either my own or any other public journal, he would\r\ncut off my left ear (and I do not think he was jesting) and send me home\r\nto my family a visibly mutilated man, to be a standing warning to all\r\nlow-lived puppies who seek to blackmail gentlemen and to injure their\r\ngood names.  And when he did so operate, he informed me that his\r\nimplement would not be a whip but a knife.\r\n\r\nWhen he had said this, unaccompanied by Mr. Lynch, as I remember it, he\r\nleft the room, for I sat down by Mr. Lynch, exclaiming: "The man is mad\r\n--he is utterly mad--this step is his ruin--it is a mistake--it would be\r\nungenerous in me, despite of all the ill usage I have here received, to\r\nexpose him, at least until he has had an opportunity to reflect upon the\r\nmatter.  I shall be in no haste."\r\n\r\n"Winters is very mad just now," replied Mr. Lynch, "but when he is\r\nhimself he is one of the finest men I ever met.  In fact, he told me the\r\nreason he did not meet you upstairs was to spare you the humiliation of a\r\nbeating in the sight of others."\r\n\r\nI submit that that unguarded remark of Philip Lynch convicts him of\r\nhaving been privy in advance to Mr. Winters\' intentions whatever they may\r\nhave been, or at least to his meaning to make an assault upon me, but I\r\nleave to others to determine how much censure an editor deserves for\r\ninveigling a weak, non-combatant man, also a publisher, to a pen of his\r\nown to be horsewhipped, if no worse, for the simple printing of what is\r\nverbally in the mouth of nine out of ten men, and women too, upon the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nWhile writing this account two theories have occurred to me as possibly\r\ntrue respecting this most remarkable assault:\r\n\r\nFirst--The aim may have been simply to extort from me such admissions as\r\nin the hands of money and influence would have sent me to the\r\nPenitentiary for libel.  This, however, seems unlikely, because any\r\nstatements elicited by fear or force could not be evidence in law or\r\ncould be so explained as to have no force.  The statements wanted so\r\nbadly must have been desired for some other purpose.\r\n\r\nSecond--The other theory has so dark and wilfully murderous a look that I\r\nshrink from writing it, yet as in all probability my death at the\r\nearliest practicable moment has already been decreed, I feel I should do\r\nall I can before my hour arrives, at least to show others how to break up\r\nthat aristocratic rule and combination which has robbed all Nevada of\r\ntrue freedom, if not of manhood itself.  Although I do not prefer this\r\nhypothesis as a "charge," I feel that as an American citizen I still have\r\na right both to think and to speak my thoughts even in the land of Sharon\r\nand Winters, and as much so respecting the theory of a brutal assault\r\n(especially when I have been its subject) as respecting any other\r\napparent enormity.  I give the matter simply as a suggestion which may\r\nexplain to the proper authorities and to the people whom they should\r\nrepresent, a well ascertained but notwithstanding a darkly mysterious\r\nfact.  The scheme of the assault may have been:\r\n\r\nFirst--To terrify me by making me conscious of my own helplessness after\r\nmaking actual though not legal threats against my life.\r\n\r\nSecond--To imply that I could save my life only by writing or signing\r\ncertain specific statements which if not subsequently explained would\r\neternally have branded me as infamous and would have consigned my family\r\nto shame and want, and to the dreadful compassion and patronage of the\r\nrich.\r\n\r\nThird--To blow my brains out the moment I had signed, thereby preventing\r\nme from making any subsequent explanation such as could remove the\r\ninfamy.\r\n\r\nFourth--Philip Lynch to be compelled to testify that I was killed by John\r\nB.  Winters in self-defence, for the conviction of Winters would bring\r\nhim in as an accomplice.  If that was the programme in John B.  Winters\'\r\nmind nothing saved my life but my persistent refusal to sign, when that\r\nrefusal seemed clearly to me to be the choice of death.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable assertion made to me by Mr. Winters, that pity only spared\r\nmy life on Wednesday evening last, almost compels me to believe that at\r\nfirst he could not have intended me to leave that room alive; and why I\r\nwas allowed to, unless through mesmeric or some other invisible\r\ninfluence, I cannot divine.  The more I reflect upon this matter, the\r\nmore probable as true does this horrible interpretation become.\r\n\r\nThe narration of these things I might have spared both to Mr. Winters and\r\nto the public had he himself observed silence, but as he has both\r\nverbally spoken and suffered a thoroughly garbled statement of facts to\r\nappear in the Gold Hill News I feel it due to myself no less than to this\r\ncommunity, and to the entire independent press of America and Great\r\nBritain, to give a true account of what even the Gold Hill News has\r\npronounced a disgraceful affair, and which it deeply regrets because of\r\nsome alleged telegraphic mistake in the account of it.  [Who received the\r\nerroneous telegrams?]\r\n\r\nThough he may not deem it prudent to take my life just now, the\r\npublication of this article I feel sure must compel Gen. Winters (with\r\nhis peculiar views about his right to exemption from criticism by me) to\r\nresolve on my violent death, though it may take years to compass it.\r\nNotwithstanding I bear him no ill will; and if W. C. Ralston and William\r\nSharon, and other members of the San Francisco mining and milling Ring\r\nfeel that he above all other men in this State and California is the most\r\nfitting man to supervise and control Yellow Jacket matters, until I am\r\nable to vote more than half their stock I presume he will be retained to\r\ngrace his present post.\r\n\r\nMeantime, I cordially invite all who know of any sort of important\r\nvillainy which only can be cured by exposure (and who would expose it if\r\nthey felt sure they would not be betrayed under bullying threats), to\r\ncommunicate with the PEOPLE\'S TRIBUNE; for until I am murdered, so long\r\nas I can raise the means to publish, I propose to continue my efforts at\r\nleast to revive the liberties of the State, to curb oppression, and to\r\nbenefit man\'s world and God\'s earth.\r\n\r\n                              CONRAD WIEGAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n[It does seem a pity that the Sheriff was shut out, since the good sense\r\nof a general of militia and of a prominent editor failed to teach them\r\nthat the merited castigation of this weak, half-witted child was a thing\r\nthat ought to have been done in the street, where the poor thing could\r\nhave a chance to run.  When a journalist maligns a citizen, or attacks\r\nhis good name on hearsay evidence, he deserves to be thrashed for it,\r\neven if he is a "non-combatant" weakling; but a generous adversary would\r\nat least allow such a lamb the use of his legs at such a time.--M.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n']
